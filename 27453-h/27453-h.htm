<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h3>A SON OF THE WEST</h3>
</div>

<p>Out of the brooding darkness was born
the first timid blush of the morn. It
sprang to life along the serried edge of
the Medicine Bow, a broadening band of blood-red
light. For one instant it seemed that some
titan breath had blown at the source, darkening
the red to purple; and then, with startling suddenness,
the whole wide range flamed up. The
full red rim of the sun smote aloft, sending the
shades scuttling down the valleys, to vanish in
thin air.</p>
<p>The man at the window of the Medicine Bow
Hotel drew in his breath with a slight hissing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_2' name='page_2'></a>2</span>
sound, as the whole magnificent landscape
sprang into dazzling light. It had always taken
him like that. He remembered the day when, as
a boy of seven, he had first seen the sun soar over
the ridge, from the old &#8220;Prairie Schooner&#8221; encamped
in &#8220;The Garden of the Gods.&#8221; No less
wonderful was it now; for Jim Conlan, late
owner of Topeka Mine, and almost millionaire,
was but a magnified version of the boy of twenty-three
years back. Time had brought its revenges,
its rewards, its illusions; but the great winds, the
everlasting hills, and the wild life of the West
had combined in cementing the early resolutions
and ideas.</p>
<p>He had won through by dint of muscle and
hard thinking. He saw now that the secret of
his success was determination. He had earned a
reputation for never letting go anything to which
he had put his hand. Men feared him, but loved
him at the same time. He had proved himself to
be a staunch friend but an implacable enemy.
His six feet three inches of bone and sinew was
usually sufficient to scare off any trouble-seekers.
Colorado Jim, as they called him, was the product
of primal Nature, unpolished, rough as the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_3' name='page_3'></a>3</span>
gaunt mountains of the Medicine Bow, and as
inscrutable.</p>
<p>All through the short summer night he had sat
at the window waiting for the dawn. The man
who never let go had let go something this time,
and that something was nothing less than his
whole life. He never believed it would hurt him
like it did. For the past three years he had been
restless. The soul and mind of him ached for
expansion. The chief incentive to work had
gone. He had more money than he could spend&mdash;in
the West. Yonder was New York, Paris,
London. Alluring visions of civilization flashed
through his brain. What was the use of money
if not to burn, and where in the whole of
Colorado could one burn money and get full
value?</p>
<p>The idea to sell out began to obsess him, and
in the end he sold. Hating sentimentality and
fearing any demonstration of such, he had
packed up secretly and left the rough shack by
the Topeka Mine for the comparatively Arcadian
comforts of the hotel in the township ten miles
back. In a few hours he would be on the train
bound for the East&mdash;and the future.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4' name='page_4'></a>4</span></p>
<p>Thorough in all things, he had packed his bags
overnight, leaving but a few necessities such as
razor and tooth-brush (recent acquisitions) to
complete. He left the window now with a
curious sigh, and gave a last pull on the strap of
the largest bag with his big, muscular hands.
Even now, with the ramshackle stage-coach almost
at the door, he could not bring himself to
believe that the old life was over and done with.
What the devil was he up to, anyway, hiking
around in creased trousers and black boots?
Colorado Jim bound for Europe&mdash;London! It
sounded impossibly fantastic. But there it was,
written on the labels of his bags&mdash;&#8220;James Conlan,
London, via New York.&#8221; He tucked the rebellious
collars of his soft blue shirt into his waistcoat,
and pulled out an enormous watch.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rob ain&#8217;t on time,&#8221; he muttered; then,
&#8220;Emily!&#8221;</p>
<p>A voice that sounded like the action of a saw
in contact with a nail came from below.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My bill&mdash;quick!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you ain&#8217;t had no breakfas&#8217; yet.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5' name='page_5'></a>5</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Ain&#8217;t takin&#8217; none. Come along right now
and give a hand with these grips.&#8221;</p>
<p>The owner of the voice, a shriveled-up, extremely
untidy girl of about eighteen, with her
hair in &#8220;crackers&#8221; and her eyes scarcely more
than half open, entered the room, and stood
gaping at him. She had gaped at him consistently
for two whole days, and he didn&#8217;t like
it. He wasn&#8217;t used to women&mdash;didn&#8217;t understand
them and didn&#8217;t want to. He didn&#8217;t even understand
that the romantic Emily had fallen passionately
in love with him exactly forty seconds
after her sleepy eyes had first beheld him.</p>
<p>&#8220;For God&#8217;s sake don&#8217;t stare at me! Take the
grips, gal, take &#8217;em. Not that one, it would
dislocate your internals.&#8221;</p>
<p>She dropped the big one like a hot brick and
grabbed the two smaller ones. At the door she
found opportunity to scan him once more, and
to murmur under her breath, &#8220;Lor&#8217;, ain&#8217;t he
wonderful!&#8221; before her master came along and
ended her rapturous soliloquies. He entered the
room and nodded to Jim.</p>
<p>&#8220;So you&#8217;re making out, Jim?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Looks like it.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6' name='page_6'></a>6</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Wal, I&#8217;m sure sorry, and there ain&#8217;t a guy in
these parts who ain&#8217;t sorry too.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim shrugged his big shoulders and jerked out
his chin.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe there ain&#8217;t one more sorry than yours
truly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jest that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s junk you&#8217;re talking.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim smiled whimsically.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nope, it&#8217;s God&#8217;s truth. I didn&#8217;t figure it all
out till I came here. I wish I hadn&#8217;t sold out. I
guess I&#8217;m best fitted for running mines or herding
cattle, Dan. And I&#8217;m leaving all the boys
who know me for those who don&#8217;t&mdash;and I don&#8217;t
git on with folks who don&#8217;t know me. God
knows what persuaded me to sell to that
macaroni-eating swab. But it&#8217;s done, and there
ain&#8217;t no manner of good wailing about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dan laughed lugubriously.</p>
<p>&#8220;A man that can knock a million out of a
mountain can git along most anywheres, I guess.
Wish I had your chance.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;d you do?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7' name='page_7'></a>7</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d hitch up to some smart gal in New York
or London and start a family.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim made a grimace.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Pears to me you ain&#8217;t strong on originality.
I&#8217;d rather run a cattle ranch&mdash;they don&#8217;t talk
back.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gosh! man, wimmen&#8217;s all right if you know
how to treat &#8217;em. They&#8217;re like bosses, they want
careful breakin&#8217; in.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim shook his head. He remembered the time
when a girl from down East, on a holiday tour,
had looked over his mine. Her eloquent blue eyes
had made him feel decidedly sheepish. Colorado
Jim, who had tackled most of the bad men
around Medicine Bow, and had tamed the wildest
bronchos that ever roved prairie, was lamentably
lacking where the fair sex was concerned. He
didn&#8217;t know what to do, what to say, or how to
say it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dan,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you hev to have a gift that
way&mdash;an&#8217; I ain&#8217;t got it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My lad, you&#8217;ve got a figure and a &#8217;physog&#8217;
that&#8217;ll sure turn every gal&#8217;s head that takes a
slant at &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let up!&#8221; growled Jim.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s honest truth, laddie. Gee! I gotta
hankering for the bright lights myself. I lived in
New York once. <i>Some</i> village. And with a
million in your wallet ... Ah!&#8221;</p>
<p>He gave a long sigh as he reflected upon the
quantity of &#8220;bright lights&#8221; a million would purchase.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d have three houses, a hundred suits, a
footman with a powdered wig like I seen in the
magazine pictures. I&#8217;d have a bath each night
in eau-de-Cologne, and go to roost in real silk
peejamas. I&#8217;d larn to dance, and have a valee to
dress me and shave me....&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yep,&#8221; mused Jim, &#8220;and then you&#8217;d wake up,
Dan. Here, where&#8217;s that bill? You talk too
much. What in hell is that?&#8221;</p>
<p>A terrific hullabaloo came up from below. A
roar of laughter and the babble of male voices
was mixed with the rumble of wheels and the
pistol-like crack of a whip.</p>
<p>&#8220;Looks like a celebration,&#8221; said Dan.</p>
<p>Jim sauntered to the window. Underneath
was Rob&#8217;s coach, packed full of miners. They
slid from the roof of the vehicle and from inside,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span>
and began to fire revolvers and dance around like
niggers. Then one of them saw Jim.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hi, Colorado Jim, come out of that!&#8221; he
bawled.</p>
<p>Jim ducked back from the window as a roar
came up from below.</p>
<p>&#8220;Looks like they&#8217;re for giving you a send-off,&#8221;
said Dan.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who told them? I kept it quiet&mdash;can&#8217;t stand
ceremonies.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It must have been Rob.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Confound him! There&#8217;s no time for kissing.
It&#8217;s fifty miles to Graymount, and the train is
scheduled for noon. Send &#8217;em away.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dan opened his eyes with horror at the suggestion.</p>
<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t takin&#8217; risks. You got heaps of time.
It&#8217;s only five o&#8217;clock and the road is good to
Graymount.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;More&#8217;n Rob&#8217;s hosses are. That off-side
mare&#8217;s like a sausage on four crooked sticks.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jim! We want Colorado Jim!&#8221; was howled
up from below.</p>
<p>The much desired went to the window.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Boys,&#8221; he bawled, &#8220;you all run along home.
I gotta catch a train.&#8221;</p>
<p>His voice was drowned by horrible threats of
what they would do if he didn&#8217;t hike down immediately.
He turned to Dan.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re a darn fine lot of boys, but I wish
they wouldn&#8217;t git so worked up. Where&#8217;s
Emily?&#8221;</p>
<p>Emily, who was standing in the doorway,
ogling him unseen, came forward.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s something to buy a dress with, and
see here, don&#8217;t get a draughtboard pattern. If
there&#8217;s any money over, buy soap&mdash;scented
soap.&#8221;</p>
<p>Emily&#8217;s eyes almost fell from her head at the
sight of the fifty-dollar note. She rubbed her
hands down her dress and took it. Jim had
grabbed the heavy bag and was half-way down
the stairs before she could summon enough
breath to murmur the incessant refrain, &#8220;Ain&#8217;t
he jest wonderful!&#8221;</p>
<p>At the door Jim was grabbed by a dozen hefty
pairs of hands and hoisted on to shoulders. One
man took the big bag, and with remarkable skill
flung it clean on the top of the waiting coach,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span>
much to Rob&#8217;s disgust. The hurtling missile
came down like a thunderbolt, and nearly went
through the roof.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t get fresh, boys,&#8221; pleaded Jim. &#8220;These
are my Sunday clothes.&#8221;</p>
<p>They ran him twice up the main street, yelling
and whooping like a pack of wild Indians. A
queer awry figure stuck its head from the window
of a tumble-down shop and, seeing the cause of
the disturbance, shook his fist and yelled:</p>
<p>&#8220;The sheriff ought to be fired, to allow ...&#8221;</p>
<p>A shot from a revolver shivered his shop-window
to atoms, and a ten-dollar note was
flung at him. He slammed down the window,
realizing that discretion was the better part of
valor. The high-spirited men went on their way,
rousing the whole population as they progressed.
After about twenty minutes of these capers they
reached the hotel again. Jim was praying that
the business was over. He fought his way to the
ground, but was immediately hoisted on to the
top of Rob&#8217;s coach.</p>
<p>&#8220;Give over, boys ...&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is the whitest man in Medicine Bow?&#8221;
sang Ned Blossom.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Colorado Jim!&#8221; howled the chorus.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is the huskiest two-hundred-pounder in
the hul of Ameriky?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Colorado Jim!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is it the gals all lu-huv?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Colorado Jim&mdash;sure!&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim swung his big figure over the side of the
coach. He grabbed two of his tormentors by the
scruffs of their necks and jerked them on to the
ground.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m through with all this,&#8221; he cried. &#8220;Rob,
get that animated bunch of horse-hair going.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ned Blossom held up his hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cut it out, boys,&#8221; he ordered. &#8220;See here,
Jim, we got wise to this absconsion of yours, and
we thought we&#8217;d jest bunch in. The boys are
feeling queer about it, though there ain&#8217;t much
show of handkerchiefs. We&mdash;we thought mebbe
you&#8217;d accept a little&mdash;kinder keepsake. It&mdash;it
ain&#8217;t much, but&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash; Wal, here it is.&#8221;</p>
<p>He jerked something from his pocket and put
it into Jim&#8217;s hand. It was a gold cigarette-case,
with an inscription worked in small diamonds:
&#8220;To Colorado Jim from his chums.&#8221; Jim stood
gazing at this token of their regard. He hated
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
sentiment, and yet was as big a victim of it as
anyone. When he spoke his great voice wavered.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going a hell of a distance before I find
boys like you. I wish I wasn&#8217;t going. I&mdash;wish&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He grabbed Ned&#8217;s hand quickly, and then that
of each of the other men, and jumped into the
coach. They understood the emotion in the big
heart of him. Rob started the team and away
went the coach in a cloud of dust. Hats went up
in the air and revolvers barked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-bye, Colorado Jim! Good-bye!&#8221;</p>
<p>Emily at the door, clasping the fifty-dollar
note in her grimy paw, waited until the coach
was a mere dot in the distance. Then she rubbed
a sorrowful eye.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gee, but he was jest wonderful!&#8221; she moaned.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3>THE BRIGHT LIGHTS</h3>
</div>

<p>New York brought Jim Conlan up
with a start. Everything was amazing;
everything was bewildering. He felt
like a lost soul, stunned with the noise, dazed by
the sights. In the fastnesses of his beloved West
he had never imagined that such a place existed
on the face of the earth. He felt stifled and ill
at ease. His clothes were different to those worn
in this city. People gave him a quick passing
glance, knowing him at once for a Westerner.
Feeling a trifle embarrassed under their glances,
he reflected upon the advisability of buying new
and more appropriate garb. A tailor was requisitioned
and, finding his client to be indifferent in
the matter of costs, fixed him up with a fine
wardrobe&mdash;and a fine bill.</p>
<p>Jim spent the best part of two hours trying
on the new things. The long mirror in his bedroom
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
did its best, but it wasn&#8217;t good enough for
Jim. He groaned as he saw this stranger staring
at him from the mirror. He wasn&#8217;t built for that
sort of garb. The hard hat looked perfectly
idiotic and the starched collars nearly choked
him. Eventually he tore the offending article
from his sunscorched neck and flung it across the
room. The other things followed. He stood
once more in the rough gray clothes that served
for &#8220;best&#8221; out West, and jammed the comfortable
Stetson hat on his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m darned if I&#8217;ll wear &#8217;em!&#8221; he growled.</p>
<p>A few days of shopping and theaters, and he
began to grow homesick. Thoughts of Colorado
and the boys constantly flickered in his brain.
Here he was an outcast&mdash;a nonentity. He was
not good at making friends, and the New
Yorkers were not falling head over heels to shake
hands with him, though more than one pair of
eyes looked admiringly at his magnificent
physique.</p>
<p>The loneliness of big cities! How terrible a
thing it was. Never at any time had Jim felt so
lonely. The rolling wind-swept prairie had at
least something to offer. In every manifestation
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span>
of nature he had found a friend. The wind, and
the hills, and the wild animals seemed in some
queer way sterling comrades; but here&mdash;&mdash; He
began to hate it. It was one huge problem to
him. How did it live? What did all the millions
do for a subsistence? It was the first time he
had seen the poor&mdash;the real, hopeless, inevitable
poor. He had seen men &#8220;broke,&#8221; down to their
last cent; men on the trail, starving, and lost to
all sense of decency. But that was merely transitory.
These people were different; they were
born poor, and would be poor until their bones
were laid in some miserable congested cemetery.
He found them actually reconciled to it&mdash;unquestioningly
accepting their fate and fighting to
postpone the end for as long as possible. It
sickened him.</p>
<p>Oh, Colorado! With your wide prairie and
your eternal peaks, your carpeted valleys and
your crystalline streams, your fragrant winds
and your gift of God&mdash;good men!</p>
<p>He was sitting in the lounge of his hotel one
evening, feeling more than usually homesick,
when he noticed a beautiful woman sitting near
him. Her evening dress was cut well away at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
the shoulders, displaying a white neck around
which a pearl necklace glowed in the light. A
mass of auburn hair was coiled up neatly round
her head, with a rebellious little curl streaming
down one ear.</p>
<p>The curl fascinated Jim. He thought it ought
to be put back in its proper place, but a second&#8217;s
reflection revealed to him the fact that it was
intended to trickle thus alluringly. It was there
for effect. It enhanced her considerable charm.
In the midst of his interested survey she turned
and caught his eye. He began to study his boots
with an embarrassed blush. When he ultimately
stole another glance at this wealth of feminine
beauty he found she was busily engaged in similar
scrutiny&mdash;of himself. They both smiled.
Then she stood up, languidly, and came across
to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pardon me, but you are from the West,
aren&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Right first time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, I thought so. You Westerners can&#8217;t
disguise yourselves. I love the West. I was
born in Wyoming.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span></p>
<p>Here at last was a sympathetic soul. Jim
edged along a little. She sat down.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t like New York?&#8221; she queried.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t,&#8221; he replied emphatically. &#8220;It leaves
me gasping for breath.&#8221;</p>
<p>She nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;I felt like that when first I came down. I
wish I were you to be going back again.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;m not going back.&#8221;</p>
<p>She opened her brilliant eyes and then
laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know. You&#8217;ve made a pile and are now seeing
life. Is that it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Something like that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I knew it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim was getting his nerve back. It was the
first time he had been in close proximity to a
powdered back and rouged lips, and the sensation
was curious. No man with blood in his veins
could help admiring the soft lines of her neck and
arms&mdash;and Jim had plenty of blood about him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;d you say you hailed from?&#8221; he
queried.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rock Springs, Wyoming. D&#8217;you know it?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Know it? I should say! Wal, if that ain&#8217;t
the pink limit!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We ran a ranch there,&#8221; she went on in a rich
musical voice. &#8220;I wish I was there now, but
there&#8217;s a spell about cities. You&#8217;ll find that out
soon enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t seen much spell about this one,&#8221;
retorted Jim. &#8220;Gee! I&#8217;ve never seen such a
bunch of blank-mangy-looking men. The wimmen
ain&#8217;t so bad.&#8221;</p>
<p>She laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And cyards! Suffering Moses! I seen a
guy deal a straight flush to himself and no one
savvied he&#8217;d got the pack sandpapered. Out in
Medicine Bow he&#8217;d hev&#8217; bin filled up with lead
to his shoulder-blades. I guess this is a darn bad
place.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re lovely!&#8221; she said merrily. &#8220;But when
in Rome, do as Rome does. Do you go to dinner
in that rig-out?&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim felt nervously at his throat.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong with it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing. It suits you admirably. But the
hotel won&#8217;t like it.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span></p>
<p>&#8220;See here,&#8221; he retorted, &#8220;I don&#8217;t give a
tinker&#8217;s cuss what the hotel likes. Anyway, it&#8217;s
decent, which is considerably more&#8217;n some of the
dresses I&#8217;ve seen. There&#8217;s a gal with nothin&#8217;
more&#8217;n a bit of muslin she could fold up and put
in her mouth. She&#8217;s got Mother Eve beaten to
a frazzle.&#8221;</p>
<p>They gossiped for half an hour, and then
Edith (he heard a friend call her by that name)
left him and went to dinner. The next meeting
happened on the following day. Edith&#8217;s company
appealed to him. She certainly used a lot
of &#8220;make-up,&#8221; and creams that smelt like a
chemist&#8217;s shop; but all New York smelt vile to
Jim, so he didn&#8217;t complain.</p>
<p>Taking his courage in both hands, he invited
her to dine with him. She accepted with as
much eagerness as maidenly modesty would
permit, and Jim went off to lunch in the best
hotel in town, to take careful note of the proper
procedure of a gentleman &#8220;standing treat&#8221; to a
lady. He got it off fairly well, making notes on
a sheet of paper. Then he went to his room and
rehearsed it all. He started dressing himself
about five o&#8217;clock, and had nearly got his clothes
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
to his satisfaction by the appointed time&mdash;seven-thirty.</p>
<p>The dinner was a roaring success. Conversation
was feeble because all his time was taken up
in observing correct decorum. Edith sat and
regarded him with curious eyes. She wondered,
for good reasons, what the emotions of such a
man might be. Behind those quiet, simple eyes
of his there occasionally flashed something that
made her afraid&mdash;dreadfully afraid. She had
not wasted time that day. She knew this big, uncultured
fellow was James Conlan, late of
Topeka Mine&mdash;a millionaire.</p>
<p>Jim breathed a huge sigh of relief when they
left the dining-hall and walked through the
lounge into the wide balcony. He was standing
looking out over the street when he noticed her
totter and clutch a chair.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong?&#8221; he gasped.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I feel faint. I&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>She closed her eyes. Here was a situation that
had not been rehearsed by Jim. He wondered
whether he ought to ring the fire alarm or call
the police. Edith solved the problem.</p>
<p>&#8220;If&mdash;you will assist me&mdash;to the elevator&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span></p>
<p>He had never thought of that. He grabbed
her arm and helped her to the elevator. She still
looked pale and distressed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fourteenth floor. No. 633!&#8221; she murmured.</p>
<p>They left the elevator at the fourteenth floor.
No sooner had the lift disappeared than Edith
collapsed on the floor. He looked round for a
friend in need, but the corridor was deserted.
The door near at hand was numbered 630. So
633 must be near by! He stooped and picked up
the still figure as though she were a child. In
half a dozen strides he was at 633. The door was
unlocked, so he pushed it open and entered. He
found the electric-light switch, and then placed
his burden gently on the bed. He was drawing
his arm from under her when she opened her
eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Water!&#8221;</p>
<p>He searched and found a water decanter and
a glass. She seemed too weak to sit up, so he
helped her by placing one arm under her head.
She sipped the liquid and looked into his eyes.
Then to his utter amazement she clasped both
her arms round his neck and pulled his face close
to hers.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Hell!&#8221; he muttered.</p>
<p>&#8220;I love you!&#8221; she said. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you see I&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, you&#8217;re bad!&#8221; he said. &#8220;Drink some
more water&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He strove to free himself, but finding he could
only do so by hurting her, refrained, and tried to
bring her to her senses. Undoubtedly she had
suddenly gone mad! The ingenuous Jim could
find no other solution. He was telling her to &#8220;be
a good kid&#8221; and not &#8220;to get fresh,&#8221; when the door
opened and slammed. He looked round to find a
tall dark man, in evening dress, surveying him
fiercely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-evening,&#8221; said the stranger cuttingly.
Jim broke away and faced the latter.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who in hell are you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ask her.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim turned to Edith. She seemed strangely
perturbed.</p>
<p>&#8220;My&mdash;my husband!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wal, I&#8217;m glad to meet you,&#8221; said Jim coolly.
&#8220;Your wife had a fit or something, so I jest
brought her along. I guess I&#8217;ll be mushing.&#8221;</p>
<p>To his amazement the man barred his path.</p>
<p>&#8220;A nice story,&#8221; he said.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span></p>
<p>The eyes of Colorado Jim narrowed to the
merest slits. He turned to the woman.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell him!&#8221; he growled.</p>
<p>She shrunk before those terrible eyes of his,
and gripped the pillow with nerveless hands.
Her lips opened but she said nothing. Jim
started, and then caught her by the shoulder.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you git me? He&#8217;s wanting to know why
I&#8217;m here. Tell him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How can I tell him?&#8221; she wailed.</p>
<p>The man laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;You needn&#8217;t waste breath. So this is how
Mr. James Conlan spends his time. It&#8217;ll make a
fine story....&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim&#8217;s brain was working fast; but he was
slow in the uptake in such circumstances as this.
The woman had seemed so genuine. Why did
she maintain silence? It was a novel experience
in his life. All the ways of this strange city were
foreign to him.</p>
<p>The man&#8217;s voice broke in:</p>
<p>&#8220;A fine story it will make in the press.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh&mdash;&mdash;!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The morals of a millionaire.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh!&#8221; growled Jim again.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe you wouldn&#8217;t like this to appear in
print?...&#8221;</p>
<p>And then Jim saw it all. It was like a story
from a magazine. He had never believed those
things could be true. But here it was in real life.
A frame-up&mdash;a dirty piece of blackmail.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t we come to terms, Mr. Conlan....&#8221;</p>
<p>The suave voice got no farther than that. He
saw six-feet-odd of bone and muscle rear up like
a piece of steel and descend on him. A great
hard hand caught him by the neck and bounced
him up and down the room.</p>
<p>&#8220;You swab! You tinhorn! I&#8217;ve manured a
potato patch with better stuff, by Gawd! And
she&#8217;s your wife, you dirty trash! She ain&#8217;t your
wife&mdash;no, sir. I savvy what she is. Suffering
rattlesnakes! I&#8217;m waitin&#8217; to hear about it.
When did you frame to put this over me? Talk
up or I&#8217;ll yank you outer the window into the
street.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Damn you&mdash;let me go!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll &#8217;damn you,&#8217; you muck! Take that!&#8221;</p>
<p>A resounding slap sounded as a hand like
leather met the man&#8217;s face. Edith screamed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Talk up!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We&mdash;arranged&mdash;it&mdash;this afternoon,&#8221; gasped
the man.</p>
<p>Jim flung him to the floor and advanced on the
pallid Edith. She retreated before him. He
was about to clasp her when a voice rang out.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hands up!&#8221;</p>
<p>He swung round to find his late victim brandishing
a revolver. An ugly leer crossed his face.
He evidently meant business. Jim stared at the
revolver.</p>
<p>&#8220;Put &#8217;em up or I&#8217;ll drill you. I can plead the
unwritten law. I&#8217;ve got you now, my buck-jumping
desperado.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim coolly blew his nose.</p>
<p>&#8220;Put &#8217;em up!&#8221;</p>
<p>He put up his hands and dropped the handkerchief.
He stooped to pick up the latter and, with
a lightning movement, caught the edge of the
mat and pulled with all his strength. The man,
standing on the end of it, came to earth with a
crash. Jim flew at him and made for the hand
that held the gun. Over and over they went like
cats. Then it was that Edith lent a hand&mdash;to her
confederate. She ran to the dressing-table and
took up a small penknife. Jim was leaning over
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
his victim, wresting the gun from his hand, when
she reached him. The knife came down twice in
his shoulder. The intense pain caused him to
drop the gun, but he picked it up again, hurled
his inert opponent across the room, and went to
Edith. The knife dropped from her fingers as
she saw the blood streaming down his white shirtfront.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t fight wimmen,&#8221; he growled. &#8220;There
ain&#8217;t nothing I can do to you, &#8217;cept this.&#8221;</p>
<p>He suddenly caught her and, holding both her
wrists in one hand, with the other tore every
shred of clothing from her.... Then without a
word he strode out of the room.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m through with this place,&#8221; he muttered.
&#8220;Bright lights! Gosh, I&#8217;m looking for where
they don&#8217;t shine so strong.&#8221;</p>
<p>Somewhere in England were the graves of his
ancestors. He didn&#8217;t want to see the graves of
his forefathers, even if he could find them, but
the desire to give London the &#8220;once over&#8221; was
now stronger than ever. The next day he booked
a steamer berth and packed his bags.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3>SOCIAL ADVANCEMENT</h3>
</div>

<p>Jim&#8217;s first impression of London was an
ocean of flying mud, through which myriads
of phantasmagorial creatures and things
moved in sullen, unceasing procession; an all-enveloping
wall of brown fog; and a roar like
unto some monster in pain. When he stood on
the Embankment and strove to get a glimpse of
the river, he came to the conclusion that &#8220;the hub
of the Universe&#8221; was not up to specification.
The famous Strand amazed him by its narrowness
and its shortness. The buildings were
dirtier than any buildings he had ever seen before,
and the people cold, self-contained, units
who seemed visibly to shrink back into their shells
at his every attempt to hold conversation.</p>
<p>For a whole week the fog and the drizzle continued
as though no sun existed, or ever could
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span>
exist. He wandered aimlessly, like a lost sheep,
wondering how long a man could swallow quarts
of dirt with his oxygen without getting permanently
transformed into a human sewer.</p>
<p>But he was getting a grip on things. His
brain was gradually adapting itself to changed
conditions. No longer did he gasp when a child
in Stepney picked up orange-peel from the
gutter and ate it. Here was the unending manifestation
of Nature&#8217;s inexorable law, the survival
of the fittest, more clearly and cruelly displayed
than in New York. Wealth and Poverty were
more definitely marked. If they merged at all,
it was away in the suburbs, or in the Jewish
quarter, whence issued, on Saturdays, thousands
of dark-skinned lads and girls, westward bound,
to spend one hectic evening in the pleasure-ground
west of St. Paul&#8217;s.</p>
<p>The East End, strangely enough, appealed to
him more than the West. He took expeditions
down among the docks, and sat in squalid public-houses
listening to the coarse conversation of
their habitués. There was always something new
to shock, or interest, the eyes. It was no strange
thing to find a woman performing certain domestic
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
avocations before a pot of beer. Some of
them brought potatoes and peas, peeling and
shelling these in the bar in preference to the
hovels which they inhabited. The &#8220;pub&#8221; was their
club and general meeting-house.</p>
<p>Once he managed to get into conversation with
one of these products of &#8220;the hub of the Universe.&#8221;
Her point of view staggered him. Her
meek acceptance of her lot sickened him. Why
didn&#8217;t she fly&mdash;she and her man&mdash;away to green
fields and fresh air, away from this plague-ridden,
dismal city? The suggestion brought from
her a peal of mirthless laughter. Later he
arrived at the truth. These people suffered from
the greatest disease of all&mdash;<i>The Fear of Living</i>.
Their hearts were rotten. They lived and died,
rooted to some few acres of mud and muck because
they feared what lay beyond. Like children
they feared the unknown. Daylight lay beyond
the jungle, but they believed it to be the pit
of doom&mdash;of empty stomachs and endless tribulation.</p>
<p>Nothing could be done for them until the
system was smashed. Unsophisticated, uncultured
as he was, he succeeded in grasping the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
root of the problem&mdash;Education. They were
living a lie. The very environment conspired to
perpetuate that lie. When one among them
stood up and averred that Life meant something
more than this, that Man was not made to eke
out his life in bitter misery, that the result of the
toil of the worker was filched by some inexplicable
process, he was immediately voted &#8220;balmy.&#8221;
They were not ripe for fighting. There was as
yet no clearly seen Cause that would rouse them
from their torpor. But one day the flood would
burst the dam of besotted ignorance, and the
human cataract would descend with appalling
force.</p>
<p>Colorado Jim, born out of Nature, succored
by the sweet winds of heaven, was learning
things. When at nights he stood at his window,
at the top of the hotel, and gazed over the vastness
of this squat monster, London, Colorado
seemed very far away.</p>
<p>Hitherto he had been a poor reader; he had
had no time for books. Now a book came into his
hands. Feeling lonely, he dipped into it. It was
Reade&#8217;s &#8220;Martyrdom of Man.&#8221; All night long
he sat and read. All the civilizations of earth
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
passed before him in perspective. It gave him a
new interest in life. He wanted to go out and
take this London by the throat. It was a
mockery of what civilization should be. It was
an insult to dead generations of men. Man had
fought and suffered and died for&mdash;this! Humanity
had labored for tens of centuries to give
birth to&mdash;this!</p>
<p>But his healthy mind recoiled from morbid
speculation. He took a trip into Devonshire,
and found there a recrudescence of the old calm
joyousness that he believed had somehow left
him. He roved the Devon hills in wind and rain,
drew into his lungs the fragrant breath of the
moorland, and felt a better man. He sang as he
walked&mdash;a great deep song that went echoing
along the valleys. Space&mdash;space! There was
the magic potion. What were Money, Success,
Power, compared to the free delights of Nature?</p>
<p>On his return to London he seriously reflected
upon the advisability of going back to Medicine
Bow. Man is a gregarious animal, and Jim was
feeling the need of friends. What envy was his
when he perceived little groups of friends,
gathered together around some table, laughing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
and making merry! He had found the big
London clubs astonishingly exclusive. A man
had to be proposed and seconded, and what not,
by existing members, who had to vouch for his
moral or social standing. Jim felt an outsider;
an alien among strange people, whose ways were
not his ways. It might have been Colorado for
him but for a totally unexpected occurrence.</p>
<p>He was returning from a trip to the Crystal
Palace, and was waiting on the railway platform
for his train, when a drunken man started a commotion
a few paces from him. Exhibiting signs
of violence, two porters came forward to remove
him. That was, apparently, exactly what he
wanted. He slipped off his coat and danced
round in ungainly fashion. The porters advanced.
He lunged out and caught the foremost
man a heavy blow under the chin. The man
reeled back and collided violently with an immaculately
dressed man who was standing on the
edge of the platform. The latter staggered, lost
his balance, and fell on to the line. A frenzied
voice screamed:</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, my God, the train!&#8221;</p>
<p>The locomotive arrived with a roar. The man
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
on the line tried to rise, but the sight of the
approaching doom paralyzed him. Women
shrieked and men stood rooted to the spot. No
one saw the big form of Jim descend like a
thunderbolt on the back of the terrified man. An
instant later the engine passed over them....</p>
<p>Underneath the moving mass Jim&#8217;s fourteen
stone of human tissue was pressed close to the
form beneath him. He was scarcely conscious of
taking the leap. His brain had yelled one distinct
order to his active limbs: &#8220;Keep him down
flat!&#8221; He had obeyed that subconsciously. For
a second or so it was pure oblivion, and then he
realized what had happened. If there should not
be enough clearance?... Any considerable
projection would mean....</p>
<p>But something happened which drove the
specter of fear away. There came a sharp pain
in his back. It grew to intense torture. A small,
red-hot cinder from the engine was eating into
his flesh. He wanted to raise his head, to put out
his arm and remove this merciless thing. But
Will prevailed. The pain grew less. The roar
ceased. He realized that the train had stopped.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
He could hear the excited murmur of voices.
Everyone seemed to be talking at once.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s another there&mdash;that big man. I tell
you....&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mary, come away....&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It went right over him. Oh, poor fellow!...&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The big man was holding him down. They&#8217;re
safe, I tell you.&#8221;</p>
<p>A quavering male voice&mdash;that of the guard&mdash;came
down through the space between the platform
and the footboard of the train.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hel-lo, down there!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yank your darned train out. There&#8217;s a
cinder half-way through my back,&#8221; growled Jim.</p>
<p>Shouts were heard and the train began to
move. It seemed an eternity before the last
coach passed over them. By that time the cinder
had grown cold. Jim kneeled up and gasped.
He caught the other man in his arms and climbed
on to the platform. The crowd rushed forward
to shake him by the hand. He could have kissed
any woman there without asking, but it never
occurred to him. His one idea was to get away
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
from this hand-shaking crowd. He made for the
waiting-room, still carrying his man.</p>
<p>&#8220;For Gawd&#8217;s sake keep that crush out,&#8221; he
begged of the station-master. The latter carried
out this difficult task with ultimate success.
When he came back the immaculate one had
recovered his senses. He was still suffering from
shock, but he found enough strength to wedge a
monocle into his eye and to survey Jim, wonderingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Great Scott&mdash;what a feat!&#8221; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>Jim was rubbing his injured back.</p>
<p>&#8220;My deah fellah, it was positively superhuman!
You saved my life&mdash;what!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s all right.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bai Jove, I should think so! It was positively
and indubitably the most courageous
thing I have ever seen or read of.&#8221;</p>
<p>His cultured lisping speech and his well-bred
air interested Jim. Here was one of the upper
ten thousand, the real flower of British aristocracy.
Jim&#8217;s eyes traveled over him, noting
the cut of his clothes and his general air of careless
lassitude. It had taken ten generations to
produce that finished article, and the man from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
the &#8220;Wilds&#8221; wondered what was the real nature
of the animal. Physically he was a degenerate.
His hands were long and tapered, and his limbs
were exceeding small. But he possessed grace of
movement. Jim felt a sneaking admiration for
the hundred-and-one little tricks of movement
that characterized the Immaculate One. But was
it only veneer? Were these polished externals
without inward counterpart? In the meantime
the Immaculate One had taken stock of his
saviour. He found much to admire in this amazing
giant, with swells of muscle outlined behind
the cloth that covered it. No man of his set could
have done what this man had done. Sensitiveness,
Culture, seemed to negate spontaneity of
action. Reason had usurped the throne of Will.
Colorado Jim only reasoned in his immature
fashion. He acted without reason, on the impulse
of the moment. Impulse had its advantages.
Had he stopped to reason, the Immaculate
One would have soon been the object of a
Coroner&#8217;s jury. Jim found the slim white hand
extended towards him. He shook it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I should&mdash;ah&mdash;like to know to whom I am
indebted?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Jim Conlan, but it don&#8217;t matter a cuss.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It matters a great deal&mdash;to me. I should like
to give you my card.&#8221;</p>
<p>He produced a gold card-case and extracted a
thin piece of paste-board. Jim scanned it:
<i>Alfred Cholmondeley, Huntingdon Club</i>.</p>
<p>&#8220;I gather you are not the sort of fellah who
loves a torrent of oral thanks,&#8221; drawled Cholmondeley;
&#8220;but if at any time I can be of the
slightest service to you, you have only to command
me.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was then that an inspiration came to Jim.
He scanned the card again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, you mean that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Try me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wal, if you&#8217;d like to balance the account good
and proper, git me into this yere club.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cholmondeley stared, and coughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s&mdash;ah&mdash;it&#8217;s a deuced expensive club.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim&#8217;s face relaxed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess I can stand the pace.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cholmondeley was at his wits&#8217; end. Of all the
impossible things on earth Jim had asked the
most impossible. The Huntingdon was the
doyen of London clubs; its titled members could
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
have filled a very large volume. And here was
this primal man of the wilderness seeking admission!</p>
<p>&#8220;It don&#8217;t matter,&#8221; said Jim, with a curl of
his lip.</p>
<p>Cholmondeley set his teeth.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do it,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s going to be demned
difficult, but it shall be done. What&#8217;s your
address?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hotel Cecil.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Count it as done.&#8221;</p>
<p>The great feat was ultimately achieved. Jim
received notification to the effect that he was
now a member on probation. By pre-arrangement
with the Immaculate One he turned up one
morning at the big building in Pall Mall. Cholmondeley,
who met him in the vestibule, nearly
had a fit when he saw him. He had tacitly
thrown out a hint that the Huntingdon was correct
in the matter of dress&mdash;and Jim turned up
in his usual garb.</p>
<p>The wind was knocked clean out of Jim&#8217;s sails
by the commissionaire&#8217;s greeting to Cholmondeley,
&#8220;Morning, your Lordship.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What did that guy say?&#8221; he exclaimed.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I forgot to tell you I&#8217;m a Viscount,&#8221; replied
Cholmondeley.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gee, what&#8217;s that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a title conferred on one of my ancestors
for something he did for his king. But it&#8217;s not
of the least importance.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim felt nervous. He wished he might have
fallen through the earth before suggesting that
he should become a member of a club of this sort.
Cholmondeley was mildly amused. He had
fought tooth and nail against the prejudices of
some of the blue bloods, who had never heard of
James Conlan in their lives and had looked him
up in Burke in vain. Cholmondeley, half-way
through his adventure, was beginning to enjoy
it. He had come to like Jim immensely, though
the latter&#8217;s speech at times wounded his tender
susceptibilities.</p>
<p>&#8220;My deah fellah, we have a stormy&mdash;ah&mdash;passage
to weather. If I may be allowed to
tender a little advice, don&#8217;t talk too much&mdash;yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim&#8217;s brows clouded.</p>
<p>&#8220;I get you. They won&#8217;t like my kind of chin-music?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span></p>
<p>&#8220;They certainly will not. Let us now have a
drink to celebrate this extraordinary occasion.&#8221;</p>
<p>They were sitting in the lounge when a boy
came in with a telegram.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lord &#8216;Chum-ley&#8217;!&#8221; he yelled.</p>
<p>He eventually spotted Cholmondeley and
gave him the telegram. Jim&#8217;s eyes opened wide.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, that ain&#8217;t your name, is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>Cholmondeley nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wal, if that don&#8217;t beat the band!&#8221;</p>
<p>A man that could make &#8220;Chumley&#8221; out of
Cholmondeley was certainly a juggler with
letters.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why in hell do you spell it that way?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Euphony, my deah chap&mdash;euphony!&#8221;</p>
<p>Who &#8220;Euphony&#8221; might have been Jim hadn&#8217;t
the foggiest notion. He relapsed into a moody
silence, wishing the club at the bottom of the sea
and himself back at Medicine Bow, where men
pronounced words in the way they were spelt&mdash;more
or less.</p>
<p>Jim&#8217;s career in that club was anything but
smooth. Under the wing of Cholmondeley he
was saved from absolute ostracism. Two weeks
of utter purgatory were lived through, but Cholmondeley
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span>
was staunch. Every day he turned up
at the club and bade Jim, on peril of his life, do
likewise.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stick it out, Conlan,&#8221; he argued. &#8220;They&#8217;re
expecting you to run away and die with humiliation.
When they discover you are not a&mdash;what
was the word you used?&mdash;ah&mdash;quitter&mdash;they&#8217;ll
begin to appreciate you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim hung on. Even when Cholmondeley was
not present he used the club. His personality
began to have effect, and he soon made two or
three firm friends. One of these was the Honorable
Claude Featherstone, a healthy, good-looking
youth, without a trace of snobbishness or
social pride in his composition. He had been the
first to come to Jim with extended hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re American, aren&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nope, I&#8217;m English all right, but America&#8217;s
my country.&#8221;</p>
<p>Claude&#8217;s eyes traveled over Jim&#8217;s muscular
figure.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ye gods! they breed &#8217;em big where you come
from. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll try catch-as-catch-can
with you. What do you think of this menagerie
of ours? That fat man over there is the Duke of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
Aberdale. If he comes and tells you a tale about
having left his purse at home&mdash;beware!&#8221;</p>
<p>Claude&#8217;s acquaintanceship ripened into intimate
friendship. It may have been pure hero-worship,
but the fact remained that he thought
Jim the finest specimen of manhood he had ever
known. Jim, on the other hand, began to drop a
few of his early prejudices. He came to realize
that all men have something in common, and
that accident of birth placed no insuperable bar
between one and another. Once penetrate that
icy reserve, and more often than not there was
a stout heart behind it.</p>
<p>Jim began to get popular. It was rumored he
was fabulously wealthy&mdash;a slight exaggeration&mdash;and
this helped him through, for the money-worship
fetish prevailed even among &#8220;noble
lords.&#8221; Cholmondeley, who knew all the ropes
in this intricate mesh of British social life, intimated
that a peerage might be bought for
£50,000. But Jim wasn&#8217;t &#8220;taking any of that
dope.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It won&#8217;t make my blood any bluer, I guess,&#8221;
he said.</p>
<p>In two months he had thoroughly established
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span>
himself&mdash;a plebeian had taken root in a forest of
belted earls and lisping aristocrats. But it
stopped at that. A retired &#8220;cowboy&#8221; was all
very well in a club. If he chose to take up &#8220;gun-throwing&#8221;
or garrotting, there was always a
score or two of hefty servants to deal with him;
but in a man&#8217;s home, with wives and daughters
present, well&mdash;&mdash;! So Jim&#8217;s meteoric social
ascent went no farther than that. Even Cholmondeley,
who was his eternal debtor, never took
him to house parties. Jim had introspection
enough to see the barrier.</p>
<p>It was towards the end of winter that Jim
created a commotion which was nearly the cause
of his being &#8220;blackballed.&#8221; But for the intervention
of his considerable circle of admirers, who
believed his action to be justified, and threatened
to resign <i>en bloc</i> if the matter were not quashed,
Jim would have shaken the dust of the Huntingdon
from his feet.</p>
<p>It was in the afternoon, and a trio of men were
seeking for a fourth to make up a card party.
Seeing Jim lounging on a settee they invited him
to join in. He rather reluctantly assented, for
one of the players was Meredith, a man he disliked
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
intensely, which dislike was thoroughly
reciprocated.</p>
<p>They played all the afternoon, and Meredith
won steadily. He talked a lot about his abnormal
luck, but one man present seemed to be constantly
on the fidget. Jim had been weaned on
cards in a place where gambling was the salt of
life, and &#8220;tinhorns&#8221; were as plentiful as mosquitoes
in summer. He kept his eyes on the slim,
nimble hands of Meredith, and what he saw did
not please him.</p>
<p>Meredith was in the middle of a deal when Jim
suddenly flung his cards across the table and
stood up.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m through with this,&#8221; he growled.</p>
<p>The other players gasped, and Meredith&#8217;s
brow contracted. By this time the room was full
of members lounging and talking before dinner.
The tone of Jim&#8217;s voice suggested that something
was wrong.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221; asked one of the players.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like the deal.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meredith leaped from his chair.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you dare insinuate....&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t insinuate nothin&#8217;. I jest ain&#8217;t playin&#8217;
this hand.&#8221;</p>
<p>Claude came behind him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Careful, Jim,&#8221; he whispered. &#8220;You are
making a very serious accusation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meredith came across and stood within a foot
of Jim&#8217;s taut face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Conlan,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I am waiting for an
explanation.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where I come from,&#8221; said Jim grimly, &#8220;men
who slip cards that way are lynched on the
nearest tree.&#8221;</p>
<p>A gasp came from the company. Never in
the history of the club had anything like that
happened.</p>
<p>&#8220;You liar!&#8221; snapped Meredith.</p>
<p>Jim&#8217;s hand came out. His fingers buried
themselves in Meredith&#8217;s shoulder, till the pale
face winced with pain. His great body
tightened up and his eyes were like cold steel.
No one had ever called him &#8220;liar&#8221; before. It
aroused all the innate fury within him. The
other hand was drawn back to strike&mdash;and then
he remembered. He gave an almost pitiful
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
grunt and released his grip. Cholmondeley and
a few others dragged him away.</p>
<p>&#8220;Conlan,&#8221; said Claude, &#8220;you oughtn&#8217;t to have
said that. It isn&#8217;t done.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no way out,&#8221; whispered Cholmondeley.
&#8220;You&#8217;ll have to apologize.&#8221;</p>
<p>A dapper little man, a bosom friend of Meredith&#8217;s,
hurried forward, bristling with indignation.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have grossly insulted a member of
this club, sir. We demand an apology,&#8221; he
said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Better apologize,&#8221; whispered Claude.</p>
<p>Jim was trying to be a &#8220;gentleman,&#8221; but the
word &#8220;liar&#8221; from the lips of a card-sharp had
pierced the thin veneer that a few months of
sophisticated environment had brought about,
and scratched into the coarser material beneath.
Restraint went to the winds.</p>
<p>&#8220;Apologize!&#8221; he roared. &#8220;Apologize to a
swindling tinhorn? I should smile!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h3>ANGELA</h3>
</div>

<p>The Featherstones were a remarkable
family&mdash;remarkable in their unparalleled
irresponsibility. They had a house
in Grosvenor Place and another in Devonshire.
The latter, like the Featherstones, was gorgeous
in its external aspect, but thoroughly unstable in
its foundations. The instability of Lord
Featherstone was of a financial character. He,
like the rest of his family, believed in giving a
wide berth to such sordid considerations as
money. Whenever he wanted money he called
in the family solicitor, who promptly raised another
mortgage on something.</p>
<p>Featherstone was so used to signing his name
on pieces of paper that custom grew into habit.
Lady Featherstone still gave expensive house
parties, and the Honorable Angela acted as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
though all the wealth of the Indies was behind
those magic signatures of papa.</p>
<p>Young Claude, with a liberal allowance per
annum, managed to wring a few thousands overdraft
from his banker by dint of a plausible
tongue and a charm of manner. When the crash
came and Featherstone was forced to face
realities, the house was like a mortuary.</p>
<p>&#8220;But surely you can raise the wind, my dear
Ayscough?&#8221;</p>
<p>The aged solicitor, an intimate friend of the
family, shook his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s Little Badholme.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mortgaged to the last penny. It was never
worth the ten thousand they advanced.&#8221;</p>
<p>Featherstone paced up and down and blew
rings of smoke into the air.</p>
<p>&#8220;We shall have to economize, my dear
Ayscough. We shall have to economize.&#8221;</p>
<p>He had said that so many times before, that
like the production of his autograph it had become
a habit. Ayscough, seeing Carey Street
looming in the distance, was unusually glum.
Economy was scarcely an antidote at this stage,
for mortgagees were threatening foreclosure.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I rely upon you, Ayscough. I rely on you
absolutely.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ayscough looked blank. It was no use trying
to explain to Featherstone the exact state of the
family&#8217;s finance. Generations of Featherstones
had eaten well into the coffers. Prodigality was
their outstanding characteristic.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I might make a suggestion&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Featherstone was in the mood to consider the
wildest suggestion. He had none of his own.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is&mdash;er&mdash;Miss Angela.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There is, Ayscough. Precisely&mdash;there is.&#8221;
Then he suddenly halted and looked at the
lawyer. &#8220;By Jove! I see your point. But it
won&#8217;t avail us. Angela is a queer girl. She has
distinct aversions to marriage.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But if she knew that a wealthy&mdash;er&mdash;fortunate
marriage would save you and Lady
Featherstone a certain amount of anxiety&mdash;&mdash;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I doubt it. Besides, wealthy husbands are
not so easily picked up. There are a dozen girls
after every man of ample means. No, I think we
may discard that possibility. Think it over, my
dear Ayscough. I leave it entirely in your
hands.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span></p>
<p>Ayscough had been thinking it over for the
last three years. He went away with visions of
the fall of the house of Featherstone at no very
distant date.</p>
<p>At that moment the Honorable Angela was
busily engaged sending out invitations to a
dinner party. She was two years older than
Claude, a typical Featherstone, fair and straight
of limb, with finely chiseled features and delicate
complexion. Her eyes were large and long-lashed,
but somewhat cold. A life of indolence
and luxury had bred a certain air of imperiousness
in her. She was known to her friends as
Angela the frigid. But this appellation was not
quite justified. At times she was far from frigid.
Under different circumstances she might have
been as warm-blooded as any Southern peasant-girl,
but pride of birth and breeding had dampered
down most of the natural emotions. She
was exquisite in every physical detail.</p>
<p>She had almost finished her list of invitations
when Claude burst into the library. She turned
her head for a second and went on writing. He
strode up to the table and began to read the cards.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Please go away, Claude. Don&#8217;t touch them.
They&#8217;re still wet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Great heavens! You aren&#8217;t asking Mrs.
Carruthers!&#8221; he ejaculated.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s simply impossible. Angela, take her
off the list.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This is mother&#8217;s list, not mine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But that woman&mdash;Angela, she isn&#8217;t proper.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, ask any of her friends. Oh, by the way,
I want one of those cards. Thanks!&#8221;</p>
<p>He took one, to her great annoyance, and then
asked for a pen. She gave it to him with a little
sigh. He filled in the blank card and read it with
a grin.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother will be annoyed if you send out invitations
without consulting her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell her when I&#8217;ve posted it. It&#8217;s to a
fellow I know very well.&#8221;</p>
<p>Angela took the pen. She began to write the
last card, hesitated, and then asked:</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is he?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Man named Conlan.&#8221;</p>
<p>The pen dropped from her fingers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not your cowboy friend?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Even so, fair sister. And why not? I tell
you Jim&mdash;Conlan is the greatest thing on earth.
Oh, you&#8217;ll love him.&#8221;</p>
<p>She frowned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be ridiculous, Claude. You simply
can&#8217;t ask that man here. You told me he swore
and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But only when he&#8217;s annoyed. You swear
when you are annoyed, don&#8217;t you? I&#8217;ve heard
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Claude!&#8221; She jerked her beautiful head
upward.</p>
<p>&#8220;Swearing isn&#8217;t a matter of words entirely&mdash;it&#8217;s
an emotion. You say &#8217;bother,&#8217; I should say
&#8217;damn,&#8217; and Conlan would say something far
more effective, and they each express exactly the
same emotion. But you can&#8217;t judge a man by his
vocabulary.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I judge him by your description of him&mdash;a
retired cowboy, with few manners and less
morals&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span></p>
<p>Claude put the card into an envelope and
sealed the latter with a heavy blow of his fist.</p>
<p>&#8220;Angela, you are perfectly cattish at times.
Why shouldn&#8217;t I ask Conlan here? He&#8217;s as good
as you or I, or any of the people who visit us.
That he is rough in his ways and speech is due
to the fact that he has had to work for his living.&#8221;</p>
<p>Angela&#8217;s lips curled a little.</p>
<p>&#8220;And, moreover, unless something happens to
prevent it, I shall in all probability have to solicit
orders for motor-cars, or some other necessary
evil. You, Angela, may have to write figures in
a ledger, or look after somebody else&#8217;s children.&#8221;</p>
<p>Angela treated him to a withering glance.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not so big an exaggeration after all,&#8221;
he resumed. &#8220;You&#8217;ve seen Ayscough hanging
around of late, haven&#8217;t you? What does it
convey? We&#8217;re broke, Angela. Lord, we are
an extraordinary family! Broke, and sending
out invitations to scores of the high and mighty
as though we owned the earth!&#8221;</p>
<p>Angela flushed. Even now the specter of
bankruptcy failed to affect her. She had never
reckoned luxury in terms of money. Money
values she was positively ignorant of. Things
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span>
were ordered and delivered, and there was an end
of it. She suddenly burst into laughter.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are most amusing, Claude. Bring your
American Hercules here and we&#8217;ll charge half a
guinea for a sight of him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Claude said nothing. He posted his letter,
and meant to make it clear to Angela and the
family that Conlan was a friend of his, and therefore
should be treated as any other guest would
be. When, later, he confessed his escapade to his
parents, they were almost too shocked for words.</p>
<p>&#8220;You must write and tell him it was a mistake,&#8221;
urged Her Ladyship.</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear Claude!&#8221; expostulated Featherstone.
&#8220;You let impetuosity carry you to the
verge of insanity. What can this poor fellow&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor fellow be hanged!&#8221; retorted Claude,
now thoroughly roused. &#8220;He&#8217;s no more poor
fellow than you. He&#8217;s rich enough to buy us up
lock, stock, and barrel; and he is as proud of his
name as we are of ours, though he doesn&#8217;t make
a song about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Featherstone looked hurt at this exhibition of
filial revolt. Being a wise man he dropped the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
subject <i>pro tem</i>. Later Claude went in and
apologized.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pater, I particularly want you to meet
Conlan. He isn&#8217;t what you think him to be. If,
when you see him, you don&#8217;t approve of him, I&#8217;ll
never ask him home again.&#8221;</p>
<p>Featherstone gripped his son&#8217;s hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well, my boy. You can rely upon me.
But I do hope he won&#8217;t swear&mdash;much.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim&#8217;s sensations at receiving the invitation
were indescribable. Claude&#8217;s people were the
cream of English aristocracy. At first he decided
he wouldn&#8217;t go, but second thoughts
brought him to realize that Claude must have
arranged this, and his regard for Claude was
very deep. He hunted out the discarded dress-suit
and tried it on again. Certainly he felt more
at home in it than of yore. The collar caused him
less torture, and he managed to keep the &#8220;breastplate&#8221;
of the shirt from buckling, which it seemed
to delight in doing. He had lost some of his
facial sun-brown, and this lent him a more refined
appearance.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go,&#8221; he muttered, &#8220;if it kills me.&#8221;</p>
<p>When the great day arrived he felt as though
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
some invisible being were pouring quarts of ice-water
down his spine. He had already made
himself acquainted with &#8220;Enquire Within,&#8221; and
found that Claude&#8217;s mother should be addressed
as &#8220;Lady Featherstone&#8221;; but the question of
Angela caused him anxious moments. He
thought &#8220;Honorable Miss&#8221; sounded a little too
Japanese. He tackled Claude on this delicate
problem.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, call her anything,&#8221; said that worthy.
&#8220;What do you say to &#8217;Angy&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim didn&#8217;t feel like jesting on so serious a subject.
He decided that in Angela&#8217;s case he would
drop the ceremonial form, and call her Miss
Featherstone.</p>
<p>The memory of that evening is destined to live
as long as the body of James Conlan inhabits this
mortal coil. When he gave the servant his hat
and stick and the footman his card, and heard
that powdered monstrosity bawl &#8220;Mr. James
Conlan&#8221; to a room filled with shimmering gowns
and glistening shirt-fronts, Jim&#8217;s flesh went cold.
But the vigilant Claude helped him through.
Claude was like a streak of greased lightning,
bouncing Jim here and there to be introduced to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span>
a hundred and one people, leaving our hero
a nervous wreck.</p>
<p>Featherstone and his wife acted in the most
courteous fashion, her Ladyship having been
coerced into accepting the inevitable with as good
a grace as possible. Featherstone himself was
instantly impressed by this muscular giant,
who looked like an enlarged statue of Ph&oelig;bus
Apollo. He adjusted his monocle to get a fuller
view.</p>
<p>&#8220;Claude has spoken a good deal about you,
Mr. Conlan,&#8221; he drawled. &#8220;It is a pleasure to
meet you here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim, scarcely trusting his voice, carried out
a bow, at which much practice had been put
in.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, kid, how did I do that?&#8221; he whispered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fine!&#8221; said Claude.</p>
<p>They found Angela strolling with a girl friend
in the conservatory, which was gayly illuminated
with Chinese lanterns. They turned at the sound
of footsteps. Angela wore a dress of deep
mauve, against which her pale Grecian face and
her exquisite neck shone with enhanced beauty.
The other girl was literally outshone by her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
beautiful companion. Jim felt a hot wave run
through him. Never in his life had he seen anything
so amazingly beautiful as Angela. He
heard Claude&#8217;s introduction, and bowed automatically.
Then Claude did the most outrageous
thing: he took the arm of Angela&#8217;s companion
and tripped away with her.</p>
<p>Jim was horrified. He looked round seeking
for some way of escape, but there was none.
Angela&#8217;s face relaxed in a cold smile as she
realized the terrible nervousness of this big uncouth
man. It pleased her somewhat to feel that
she was the cause of it.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are a member of my brother&#8217;s club,
aren&#8217;t you?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yep&mdash;yes,&#8221; he stuttered.</p>
<p>He wondered if he ought to offer his arm as
Claude had done to the other girl, and escort her
back to the house; but he dare not. There was a
seat near by. Angela sank into it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t you sit down?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>He did so, with a sigh of relief. He was more
at his ease sitting than standing. For the first
time in his life he was ashamed of his size.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
Angela&#8217;s delicate limbs and hands made his, by
contrast, appear elephantine.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you been long in England?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Few months.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And what do you think of it?&#8221;</p>
<p>Here was a question that was easy enough to
answer.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess it&#8217;s a cute little country, but it ain&#8217;t
big enough for a man to breathe in. There&#8217;s no
wind, no sunshine. And the people are as cold
as the climate.&#8221;</p>
<p>Angela laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;So we are cold?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oysters. I came the hul way from Devonshire
to London in a train with another guy&mdash;man.
&#8217;Good-morning,&#8217; says I. &#8217;Good-morning,&#8217;
says he&mdash;and that&#8217;s all there was to it. It beats
me, this frostiness&mdash;ain&#8217;t natural.&#8221;</p>
<p>Angela winced at the speech. The mutilated
Anglo-Saxon caused her almost physical pain,
yet the voice was musical enough and deep as a
bassoon.</p>
<p>&#8220;All you Americans say the same thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I ain&#8217;t American. I was born in Cornwall.
Went to Colorado in &#8217;82 and sailed round
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
in a prairie schooner, with wild Injuns after our
scalps. I reckon that was no picnic for my
people. I was a little fellow then&mdash;not big
enough to tell an Injun from a bear. We didn&#8217;t
find gold, but we found God&#8217;s own country.
Wal, I can&#8217;t remember much about it&mdash;thank
God, I can&#8217;t remember much.&#8221;</p>
<p>She looked at him, amazed by the tenseness of
his words.</p>
<p>&#8220;What don&#8217;t you wish to remember?&#8221;</p>
<p>His brows contracted and the big hands closed
till the knuckles almost penetrated the skin that
covered them.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Injuns got us in the end,&#8221; he said
huskily. &#8220;I jest remember the huge red sun going
down on the prairie, with the wagon and
two tents down by a stream, where the horses
were watering. There was a kind o&#8217; grotto affair
beyond the stream. Old Sam, the driver, came
and yanked me into that. I was young, but I
savvied what it meant.... It was hell arter
that&mdash;shooting and screaming.... When I
came out.... When I came out....&#8221;</p>
<p>He said no more. His eyes were staring into
nothingness as through his brain flashed the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span>
dreadful scene of youth. He remembered running
and crying&mdash;running and crying into the
wilderness until a party of emigrants rescued him
from madness.</p>
<p>Angela sat with parted lips. It was strange
to be sitting there listening to such horrors. She
was conscious of the giant personality behind his
nervousness. The great voice commanded her
attention. In those few moments she was afraid
of him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let us go in,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>The rest of the evening was a dream to Jim.
Occasionally people stared at him as though he
were a creature from a menagerie, and several
adventurous folks actually talked with him. But
all this was like a hazy background against which
shone the almost unearthly beauty of Angela. A
new phase had been entered in the life of Colorado
Jim. Passion, long dampered down by wild
living and arduous toil, leaped up in one soul-consuming
flame. He was in love with a woman&mdash;a
woman as far above him, and as unattainable
as a star. He moved about like a drunken man,
bewildered by this new and terrible desire.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What do you think of Angy?&#8221; queried
Claude.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you tell me?&#8221; he said fiercely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell you what?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me she was like that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What on earth are you talking about?&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim shut his mouth with a snap.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothin&#8217;,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>These Featherstones knew how to enjoy themselves.
For hour after hour the dreamy strains
of waltz music came from the string orchestra,
and couples moved rhythmically round the big
room, as though fatigue was a thing unknown.
Once or twice Jim caught sight of the angel of
his dreams, with face no longer pale, hanging on
some man&#8217;s arm, immersed in the all-consuming
measure. It was maddening....</p>
<p>He was sitting in the conservatory, smoking,
when Featherstone came out. All the evening he
had kept an inquisitive eye on Jim. This was
Featherstone&#8217;s mental day, and one of those rare
occasions when he thought about money and
things.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, Mr. Conlan,&#8221; he drawled. &#8220;So you
don&#8217;t dance?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No&mdash;leastways, not that sort.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pity. Dancing is a fine exercise.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess I&#8217;m not in want of exercise.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No?&#8221; He looked at Jim&#8217;s huge figure.
&#8220;&#8217;Pon my word, I think you&#8217;re right.... Are
you settling down in this country&mdash;buying a
small estate, making the most of your fortune,
and all that sort of thing?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There ain&#8217;t no place in this country big
enough to hold me long. I could swaller all the
oxygen in the Strand in one gulp.&#8221;</p>
<p>Featherstone laughed amusedly.</p>
<p>&#8220;London isn&#8217;t England. It&#8217;s a growth upon
the land. There is still Wales, Scotland, Devonshire&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, Devonshire! Now, that is some pretty
little garden, I agree.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you like it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So do I. Wish I might live there always, but
one must consider one&#8217;s family, and Bond Street
and the Opera have their attractions for the
young people. That is why I am selling the
Devonshire place. Can&#8217;t let good property lie
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
unoccupied, and letting is so devilishly unsatisfactory.&#8221;</p>
<p>He was congratulating himself he had wrapped
that pill up not so badly for an unbusiness-like
man. Jim took the bait quite well, too. He
didn&#8217;t want to buy any property, but he wasn&#8217;t
averse to keeping on the right side of Featherstone.
Where Featherstone was there was
Angela, and he might extend negotiations over
months of time and then &#8220;turn down&#8221; the proposition
if he felt like it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, is that property sold yet?&#8221; he queried
casually.</p>
<p>&#8220;No. It was only recently that I decided to
sell. I have another country place in Kent,
much more convenient.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mebbe I could see it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly. My agent will be pleased to show
you over.&#8221;</p>
<p>As an afterthought he added: &#8220;Better still,
we are spending a fortnight there, and I should
be happy if you would spend the time with us.
You could&mdash;ah&mdash;then examine the place at your
leisure.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim&#8217;s eyes glistened. The prospect of a fortnight
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span>
in close proximity to Angela&mdash;it was magnificent,
unbelievable! He strove to control his
eagerness.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be sure pleased,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Jim went home with his brain in a whirl. Love
had come, late, but with tremendous fury. He
gained no sleep that night. The star of his desire
shone like a mocking mirage before his mind&#8217;s
eye. It was all impossible, hopeless, but to love
and lose were better than to live in ignorance of
life&#8217;s strongest passion. To dally with the impossible
were sheer madness, he knew that. But
what was to be done but obey the yearnings of his
heart, though it brought its own revenge?</p>
<p>The next morning saw Featherstone in a
perfectly angelic mood. The cause was soon
revealed.</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear,&#8221; he confided to his wife, &#8220;I have
sold Little Badholme.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Claude!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, I thought that would come in the nature
of a surprise.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you said it was mortgaged?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite so, but I shall get a sum much in excess
of the mortgage.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But who&mdash;&mdash;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That American fellow&mdash;Conlan; not a bad
chap, not at all a bad chap.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lady Featherstone looked a trifle hurt. She
looked more so when her noble spouse added:</p>
<p>&#8220;So I&#8217;ve invited him down with us for a fortnight
to look over the place.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Claude! Whatever has taken possession of
you? I thought we had done with that man.
And besides, I am not going to bury myself in
Devonshire at the height of the season.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you don&#8217;t, my dear, there is likely to be no
season&mdash;for us. You must look realities in the
face. If I can sell Badholme&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you said you had sold it!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tut&mdash;tut! It is as good as sold. He can&#8217;t
refuse it after having stayed there with us. Besides,
the fellow is as rich as Cr&oelig;sus!&#8221;</p>
<p>It was accordingly settled. Featherstone sent
volleys over the telephone.</p>
<p>&#8220;Get the place thoroughly redecorated, Ayscough.
It has to be finished in three weeks.
Armies of workers.... And the blue room on
the first floor, put in a new ceiling, something
elaborate. What&#8217;s that? Can&#8217;t do it in three
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>
weeks? But it <i>has</i> to be done. I leave it to you,
my dear Ayscough.... Oh, the garden wants
seeing to. I must have the garden put straight....
And the paths graveled.... A few sheep
in the park might lend a nice effect.... Don&#8217;t
talk about impossibilities. This is a very urgent
matter. Do you think you could hire half a
dozen horses?&#8221;</p>
<p>When Claude heard the extraordinary news
that the family was leaving for Little Badholme
in three weeks&#8217; time he wondered what was in the
wind. When he subsequently learned that one
James Conlan was to visit them as guest, his
suspicions overleaped his delight. Angela, the
imperturbable, merely went on reading Bernard
Shaw.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3>FROST AND FIRE</h3>
</div>

<p>Little Badholme hung on the sheer
edge of a precipice. Its hundred acres of
park and meadow wooed the blue waters
of the Atlantic on the western side, and climbed
dizzy heights on the southern, affording the
spectator an uninterrupted view of the Dartmoor
Tors. The front of the house faced seawards
and, in bad weather, the spindrift, hurled over
the cliff, drenched the windows and the rather
unsightly stucco which the position of the house
rendered necessary.</p>
<p>Featherstone had shown considerable acumen
in giving Jim the corner room on the first floor.
It looked over country of unparalleled beauty.
Patchwork farmlands stretched away, on the one
hand, extending to the estuary of the Teign;
whilst from the windows on the western side the
rolling ocean shone under the summer sun. All
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
the best furniture had been placed in that room,
including a genuine Hepplewhite suite of beautiful
design. Jim had no eye for antiques, but he
had a fine appreciation of scenery.</p>
<p>Ten days had passed on wings of magic. He
saw Angela every day and Claude all day.
Featherstone was perfectly charming. He could
not have exhibited greater solicitude for the comfort
of his guest had he been the Shah of Persia
or the Prince of Wales. Lady Featherstone was
polite, and no more. Angela was frigid. She
seemed to be beyond his power to excite. Once or
twice she showed a slight interest in his actions
or reminiscences. She had even openly admired
his wonderful horsemanship; but she never failed
to make perfectly clear the huge gulf that loomed
between a &#8220;cowboy&#8221; and a daughter of British
aristocracy.</p>
<p>The ingenuous Claude was feeling extremely
uncomfortable. He could not bring himself to
believe that his father&#8217;s extraordinary behavior
was genuine. Politeness was one thing, but
flattery was another. All that &#8220;attention&#8221;
seemed so out of place with His Lordship, who
was notoriously vain of his name and antecedents.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span>
Claude himself was a little sick of
family pride. He had even on one occasion intimated
to his mother that he knew for a fact that
the first Featherstone got his Letters Patent for
the noble act of assassinating a certain Duke
whose wife Henry Eighth had taken a violent
liking for, a remark which so upset Her Ladyship
that she took to bed for ten days.</p>
<p>On convenient occasions Featherstone appropriated
Jim to himself and deftly led the conversation
into channels most dear to him. What
did Conlan think of the property?</p>
<p>It was by pure accident that Claude stumbled
across the plot. Featherstone was speaking to
Ayscough on the telephone, on the question of
the price of Little Badholme. Claude was flabbergasted&mdash;£25,000
for a place that was leaky
and draughty through half the year, and which
showed a tendency to slide seaward! The whole
business was disgusting. He waited until his
father had finished, and then interrogated him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pater, you&mdash;you aren&#8217;t trying to sell this
place to Conlan?&#8221;</p>
<p>Featherstone shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Conlan approached me on the matter.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But it&#8217;s not worth that price.&#8221;</p>
<p>The noble lord resented this remark.</p>
<p>&#8220;Claude, isn&#8217;t this a matter that concerns Mr.
Conlan and me? It&#8217;s not at all pleasant to find
you&mdash;eavesdropping.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Eavesdropping&mdash;great Scott! You don&#8217;t
mean you think....&#8221;</p>
<p>Featherstone came up to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t mean that. But this is a matter of
business. Mr. Conlan wants to buy and I want
to sell. He&#8217;s a perfectly free agent in the
matter.&#8221;</p>
<p>He abruptly left the room. Claude felt sick,
humiliated. It was all so perfectly clear. Jim
knew nothing about English property. It was
only natural he should place himself in Featherstone&#8217;s
hands. He determined to put a stop to
such a swindle as was contemplated. But his
plan to warn Jim was frustrated by the later
realization that Jim was madly in love with
Angela. This astonishing fact was sufficient to
drive everything else from his mind. He had no
delusion as far as Angela was concerned.
Dozens of men had tried their luck on Angela,
and Angela remained as frozen as the North
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
Pole. Poor Jim! He blamed himself for having
been instrumental in bringing this meeting
about. In her proud heart Angela would merely
despise any advances that Jim was foolish
enough to make. He watched Jim carefully for
the next two days. The evidence thus gained
was painful to bear. The honest, magnificent,
unsophisticated Jim was torn and tortured by a
mad, hopeless love. Claude could stand it no
longer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jim,&#8221; he said, &#8220;don&#8217;t think me impertinent.
I can&#8217;t help noticing&mdash;you&#8217;re in love.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim started and the color flamed up in his
cheeks.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wal.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s mad, Jim, mad. She has no heart. You
don&#8217;t know her as I do. She&#8217;s my sister and I
love her, but I can&#8217;t bear to see you living on
hopes that are doomed to be fruitless. If you
speak of this to her she&#8217;ll hurt you. She doesn&#8217;t
mean it. It&#8217;s her temperament. Don&#8217;t you see
that to a girl of Angela&#8217;s social status a proposal
from a man&mdash;like you is&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim&#8217;s eyes narrowed. He didn&#8217;t like this.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jim,&#8221; added Claude swiftly, &#8220;don&#8217;t do me
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
an injustice. I&#8217;d be damned proud to have you
as a brother-in-law. But don&#8217;t court disappointment
and pain by speaking to her&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who said I was going to speak?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can see it&mdash;in your eyes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re right. I am,&#8221; he jerked out.</p>
<p>Claude drew in his breath with a little hiss.
Jim suddenly swung round on him.</p>
<p>&#8220;See here, I&#8217;m not quitting on this. I&#8217;ve never
been a quitter and I&#8217;ve clinched bigger propositions
than this. What&#8217;s wrong with me, eh? I
guess I&#8217;ve bin taking a lot lying down of late.
Last night I see it all&mdash;cut and dried. There
ain&#8217;t nothin&#8217; in this blood business&mdash;nothin&#8217;. If
your family sprang from William the Conqueror
I guess mine was there at the time. If there&#8217;s
anything in that Adam and Eve yarn, I reckon
they were my grandparents as well as yours.
What&#8217;s wrong with me? Am I blind, lame, consumptive?
See here, kid, I know what it is to
work. I know what it is to starve. I&#8217;ve never
stolen or lied or murdered.... There&#8217;s never
been a gal on this earth that had cut any ice with
me. I&#8217;ve bin too busy working to go galivanting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
after skirts. But this &#8217;ere&#8217;s different. I&mdash;I&mdash;wal,
I guess I love her some. Oh, I know she&#8217;s
proud and cold and thinks there ain&#8217;t nothin&#8217; in
trousers good enough for her. But I&#8217;m obstinate
and I&#8217;m free with my tongue&mdash;at times. So we
both got our faults. They kinder equalize. Anyway,
I love her, and that&#8217;s good enough excuse
for anyone who cares a damn about himself.
And there ain&#8217;t no law on this earth, sir, that says
a man can&#8217;t put a straight proposition to a gal he
loves&mdash;no, by God!&#8221;</p>
<p>There was something different about him. He
had changed in one day. The old nervousness
had gone. He was dogged, determined. There
was nothing to be done with him. He meant to
speak to Angela, though she took the compliment
as a dire insult. Claude, fascinated by the ring
of his bass voice and the flash of fire from his
amazing eyes, wondered if, after all, he had not
cause for courage&mdash;and optimism.</p>
<p>But something strange happened the following
morning. Angela, with a smile, asked Jim to go
riding with her. It was the first time she had
expressed the slightest desire for his company,
and it sent thrills of delight running down his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
spine. They took the best two of the borrowed
horses, and under a perfect July sky rode out
into the moors.</p>
<p>Jim was like a boy. The intoxication of her
presence sent all the foreboding from his brain.
He did riding tricks, at her request, and set her
marveling at his uncanny control of his mount.
He seemed to be on intimate terms with the
latter, stranger though it was. Weird &#8220;cluckings&#8221;
from his mouth were understood and
obeyed without use of spurs.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s marvelous!&#8221; she said. &#8220;He seems to
understand all those noises.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s horse language,&#8221; he replied simply.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, come!&#8221;</p>
<p>He made no reply, but dismounted. The
horse stood perfectly still.</p>
<p>&#8220;You watch out,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to tell
him to walk forrard.&#8221;</p>
<p>He made a queer noise, like water running out
of a bottle, and the animal walked forward. A
slight variation of the sound, and it stopped. He
laughed at her mystified expression, and bidding
her ride on, ran at his horse and with a magnificent
leap sprang clear on to its back. In a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
second he was rushing like the wind across the
moor. He jerked up the animal until it stood
almost perpendicular on its hind-legs, and came
back to her.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s jest thinking in horse-sense,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;I ran a ranch for seven years, and you can&#8217;t do
that without thinking like a horse.&#8221;</p>
<p>They sat on the top of Hay Tor, and looked
across the tumbling country to where the sea lay
like a strip of cloth twenty miles away. Right
across the moors came the steady westerly wind,
sighing and soughing, touching their cheeks with
its fresh fingers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is Colorado better than this?&#8221; she queried.</p>
<p>&#8220;You shouldn&#8217;t ask me that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s your home, and one loves one&#8217;s home.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;One loves one&#8217;s home.&#8221; The phrase amused
her. He must have read that somewhere. She
laughed, and instinctively he knew the cause of
it. He bit his lips in anger as he realized that she
merely mocked his attempts at better speech.</p>
<p>But he forgot that later as they rode home
through the gloaming. Once only it occurred to
him that to mock her horsemanship would be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
scarcely worse than jibing at his mode of expression&mdash;a
thing which would have seemed sacrilege
in his eyes. So all the culture&mdash;if culture meant
refinement of thoughts and actions&mdash;was not confined
to the blue-blooded aristocrats!</p>
<p>Sweet dreams, Colorado Jim! Dreams of a
pair of blue eyes in the face of a Greek goddess,
with limbs that Praxiteles never surpassed. And
these to be won by a man from the wilderness!
He awoke to despise the day with its uncertainties.
She might be cold again this morning&mdash;cold
as she had been the day before yesterday.</p>
<p>But it proved to be otherwise. She greeted him
with a soft &#8220;Good-morning,&#8221; and walked with
him into the garden, among the roses and sweet-smelling
things of summer. And then&mdash;oh, wonderful,
exquisite marvel!&mdash;plucked a sprig of
mignonette, smelled it, and placed it in his
buttonhole.</p>
<p>After breakfast he bought the property; and
he bought it in a manner dear to the heart of the
vendor. He wrote a cheque, then and there, for
£25,000, and took a receipt, intimating that the
&#8220;lawyer-man&#8221; would see to all the details later.</p>
<hr class='minor' />

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span></div>
<p>Something wonderful and mysterious had happened
to Angela. Jim was too dazed to do anything
but sit and gasp. He had held her hand,
and she had let him do it. He had, with amazing
intrepidity, taken her arm walking down the long
avenue of trees, and she made no attempt to
withdraw it. Quick work was needed before
some fly came and settled in the ointment! He
got in his quick work that evening after dinner.</p>
<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t you come to the top of the hill? It&#8217;s a
full moon and a fine night,&#8221; he whispered.</p>
<p>She nodded and, getting a scarf, went out
with him. Blue, brilliant moonlight flooded the
country. From out of the trees came the eerie
cry of owls, and crickets sang out of nowhere. A
few bars of gold still lingered in the western sky,
deepening as the world moved over.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going back to-morrow,&#8221; he said suddenly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah&mdash;&mdash;!&#8221;</p>
<p>Was it a sigh, or merely an indifferent ejaculation?</p>
<p>&#8220;This holiday has been right down beautiful.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad of that.&#8221;</p>
<p>A slight breeze blew the scarf from her neck.
He took it and replaced it, and his hand touched
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
the soft warm flesh. It stayed there. He had no
power to remove it. This girl of unearthly
beauty and fascination paralyzed him. To think
that he should be sitting there with the perfectest
woman God ever made&mdash;&mdash;! The storm within
him broke. His body quivered, and his great
hand took the warm slim one and held it like a
vice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Angela&mdash;I&#8217;ve gotta tell you. I&mdash;love you.
I&#8217;ve loved you since the first night I saw you.
I&#8217;ve never wanted anything in my life like I want
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>He stopped, realizing that he was gabbing at
a terrific rate.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m rough&mdash;real rough, I know. But a
man&#8217;s a man for all that, I guess. And what can
any man offer you better&#8217;n love&mdash;love that ...
I&#8217;m no good at words&mdash;you&#8217;ll understand that.
Chin music ain&#8217;t my line. But I&#8217;m sure crazy
about you.&#8221;</p>
<p>The hand he held trembled a little, but it
stayed there.</p>
<p>&#8220;Angela&mdash;will you marry me?&#8221;</p>
<p>Her head turned. He saw the moon reflected
in two glorious eyes.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said slowly.</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean&mdash;you mean that?&#8221; he gasped, his
voice almost choked with unutterable joy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;I mean that.&#8221;</p>
<p>In another second she was swept up in his
arms. All the world went out in that passionate
embrace. For the first time in his life his mouth
touched a woman&#8217;s lips.</p>
<hr class='minor' />

<p>Featherstone paced up and down the library
under the strain of considerable emotion, not to
say excitement. Her Ladyship sat with an unread
book on her knees gazing into nothingness.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re a long time,&#8221; said Featherstone.</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps Angela&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Angela was sure,&#8221; he interrupted. &#8220;Dear,
dear! I wish they&#8217;d come back.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lady Featherstone fidgeted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Claude, I don&#8217;t like this business at all. Oh
heaven! to think of Angela married to a parvenu&mdash;a
common <i>nouveau riche</i>!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She might do far worse. Angela herself
realizes that. Conlan undoubtedly loves her.
It&#8217;s for him to win her love. Once the marriage
is celebrated, she need see him no more&mdash;er&mdash;that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
is to say, they can make arrangements whereby
they do not become a nuisance to each other. He
is apparently fond of this place, and Angela is
not. What could be more natural than for
Angela to take a flat in town and Conlan to live
here?&#8221;</p>
<p>Lady Featherstone shivered.</p>
<p>&#8220;You think this man will reconcile the situation,
once it becomes plain to him? Claude, he is
a veritable giant. I&mdash;I don&#8217;t like the look of him
at all.... Oh, why couldn&#8217;t we have waited
and found a husband for Angela in her own set!&#8221;</p>
<p>Featherstone shrugged his shoulders impatiently.</p>
<p>&#8220;Time brooks no delay. We are, my dear, in
a pretty devilish position. Thank God Angela
realizes that. Rich husbands are not to be picked
up every day, and it is essential that Angela
marries a wealthy man, and that immediately.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But to marry a&mdash;a cowboy!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He may make the best of husbands. Titles
are to be bought. I think I could arrange that.
No, on the whole I think it is a perfectly happy
arrangement for us&mdash;and for him. As Angela&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
husband he will have access to certain houses and
clubs that otherwise would be closed to him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lady Featherstone lapsed into gloomy silence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Claude was coming back to-night, too,&#8221; said
Featherstone. &#8220;I don&#8217;t like the idea of that boy
spending nights in Town. He&#8217;s getting blasé,
and at times very out of hand. What business
could he have in Town&mdash;&mdash;?&#8221;</p>
<p>Voices drifted in through the open window. A
few minutes later Jim came into the library.
Lady Featherstone immediately departed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like a word with you, Lord Featherstone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly. Take a seat.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim sat heavily in the armchair which Featherstone
offered.</p>
<p>&#8220;To come to the point right now&mdash;I&#8217;m in love
with Angela, and we want to get hitched up&mdash;er&mdash;married.&#8221;</p>
<p>Featherstone looked surprised.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess it&#8217;s a bit of a blow. But you needn&#8217;t
fly off the handle. I love her all right, and I
ain&#8217;t &#8217;xactly penniless.&#8221;</p>
<p>Featherstone stroked his chin.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are certain conditions to my approval.
You will realize that Angela occupies a prominent
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
position in the social world, and I should
naturally like to be assured that you are in a
position to provide for her in a way commensurate
with her needs. There would be, of
course, some marriage settlement. But I do not
wish to deal with that side. My lawyer, Mr.
Ayscough, is a very old family friend. He has
Angela&#8217;s interest at heart no less than I. His
assurance on the&mdash;er&mdash;financial side would be
sufficient guarantee. In such circumstances I
should see no reason to withhold my consent.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks. Put it there!&#8221; said Jim. &#8220;Now,
where does he hang out?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I beg your pardon?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where does he live?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Ayscough? Lincoln&#8217;s Inn Fields.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good. I&#8217;m off. I&#8217;ll be along there first
thing in the morning and get that settlement
fixed up. I ain&#8217;t a man that wastes time.&#8221;</p>
<p>The meeting between Ayscough and Jim was
very brief. Ayscough explained the position in
choice language, and hit up for £50,000 marriage
settlement. Jim, who didn&#8217;t quite see why he
couldn&#8217;t be trusted to look after his own wife,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>
agreed without demur and went out like a whirlwind.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gee, it&#8217;s all over bar shouting,&#8221; he muttered.
&#8220;Jim, you husky, you&#8217;re sure a lucky feller!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h3>THE GREAT AWAKENING</h3>
</div>

<p>The marriage of Colorado Jim with the
Honorable Angela created no great stir,
for the simple reason that it took place
in a registry office and received but two lines&#8217;
notice in the &#8220;social&#8221; column of the press.</p>
<p>Jim was surprised that the family should wish
to keep it so quiet, but as he himself much preferred
that method of getting &#8220;hitched up&#8221; he
made no complaint. He drove away with his
beautiful bride, feeling that the greatest step in
his life had been taken&mdash;which was certainly the
case. Where that step was to lead him he was
fortunately unable to foresee.</p>
<p>The attitude of Claude puzzled him. Since
that day in Devonshire, when Claude had endeavored
to intervene, the latter had spoken
scarcely a dozen words to him. He shook hands
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
with Jim at the station and with Angela, but his
congratulations sounded weak and insincere.</p>
<p>Jim speedily forgot him in the thrill of the
moment. Nice was their destination&mdash;Nice in all
her October glory. He was actually on honeymoon
with the object of his dreams and ambitions!</p>
<p>This chapter in Jim&#8217;s life need scarcely be
dwelled upon in any detail. It was so amazing,
so unexpectedly baffling, that it sent him clean
off his pivot of balance. All that marvelous
happiness in his heart was shattered little by
little. The first night at the hotel at Nice left
him pondering. It wasn&#8217;t due to the fact that
Angela occupied a separate room, but that he
heard her <i>turn the key in the lock</i>! He sat up
half the night &#8220;browsing&#8221; on that singular occurrence.
The second night, and every night after,
the same thing happened. Nothing else was
needed to send him into fits of inward rage. Not
for all the wealth of the Indies would he have
touched the handle of that door! Verily he was
learning. Each day drove home the lesson, until
he writhed under the lash of it. He had married
an iceberg.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span></p>
<p>He found himself very much alone. In Nice
Angela met scores of familiar faces. She spent
most of her time with these friends, leaving Jim
to the terrible naked truth&mdash;to wrestle with it as
best he might. He had kissed her at Little Badholme,
had apparently thawed for ever the chilly
heart of her. But here it was again&mdash;the frigid
exterior that no kisses could melt. What had
happened to her? Was it that she had never
cared at all&mdash;that her acceptance of his marriage
offer was dictated by ulterior motives?</p>
<p>Before it was time for them to return to England
the last scrap of illusion was knocked out of
him. More miserable than ever he had been in
his life, he sought for some solution. It was so
obvious she didn&#8217;t care for him. He saw that, in
the company of her &#8220;high-browed&#8221; friends, she
despised him. He found himself sitting down
under this contempt&mdash;meekly accepting the rôle
of enslaved husband, hand-servant to a beautiful
and presumably soulless woman.</p>
<p>On the night before they left she came back to
the hotel very late, to find him sitting in a brown
study. He watched her, furtively, discarding the
expensive cloak, and taking off the heavy pearl
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span>
necklace he had been fool enough to buy. He
stood up and stared for a moment, in silence, out
over the moonlit sea. When he turned she was
going to her room.</p>
<p>&#8220;Angela!&#8221;</p>
<p>She stopped, not liking the imperative note in
his voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wrong?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yep&mdash;with us?&#8221;</p>
<p>She shrugged her shoulders.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wasn&#8217;t aware that anything was wrong.&#8221;</p>
<p>He leaned across the table.</p>
<p>&#8220;Angela. Why did you marry me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because you asked me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No other reason, eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t that reason enough?&#8221;</p>
<p>His mouth set in a grim smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought that when wimmen married men
there was usually another reason. To take a man
and not to tell him the truth ain&#8217;t &#8217;xactly on the
level.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t begin recriminations,&#8221; she retorted.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not beginning anything,&#8221; he growled.
&#8220;I&#8217;m jest telling you we can&#8217;t go on like this,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
living in the same place and acting like strangers.
I&#8217;m beginning to get wise to this queer shuffle of
your family&#8217;s&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>She shivered a little as his intense gaze
searched her face.</p>
<p>&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t a straight proposition, because all
the perticlers wasn&#8217;t put in. I didn&#8217;t know I was
buying a woman&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>She flared up in an instant.</p>
<p>&#8220;How dare you&mdash;&mdash;!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wal, put it how you wish, it comes to the
same thing in the end. I fell to it all right, and I
ain&#8217;t squealing. If I was the sort o&#8217; man you, no
doubt, take me for, I might want value for
money, and I&#8217;m big enough to get it.... No
need to get scared. Though you love me like you
might a rattlesnake, I happen to love you. You
might as well know it.&#8221;</p>
<p>His calmness amazed her. She had half expected
a furious onslaught. On one point she
wanted to put him right.</p>
<p>&#8220;You think I despise you, but that&#8217;s not true,&#8221;
she said. &#8220;I couldn&#8217;t have married you had I
despised you. But I can&#8217;t love you&mdash;I can&#8217;t.
Can&#8217;t you see that our ways lie far apart? All
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
your life, your very mode of thought and speech,
are the direct antithesis of mine. Isn&#8217;t it plain&mdash;wasn&#8217;t
it plain at first that it was a mere
bargain? You and I can be nothing to each other
but&mdash;friends.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, it wasn&#8217;t,&#8221; he growled. &#8220;If you&#8217;d have
told me that, I&#8217;d have seen you to hell before I
married you, or even kissed you. Blood is blood,
and nature&#8217;s nature, and passion&#8217;s passion, and
gew-gaws don&#8217;t count&mdash;no, nor polite chin-music
either. You were my woman, and I wanted you
before all the other wimmen on God&#8217;s earth. It&#8217;s
the little things that don&#8217;t matter that fills your
mind. If men were all tea-slopping, thin-spined,
haw-hawing creatures like some I seen here, with
never a darned notion of how to dig for their
daily bread, though they talked like angels and
acted like cardboard saints, this world &#8217;ud be a
darned poor show.... Anyway, you&#8217;ve got to
learn that.... We&#8217;re going back to-morrow,
and I guess we&#8217;d better finish this play-acting.
Devonshire&#8217;s good enough for me if you&#8217;ll take
the London house.&#8221;</p>
<p>She nodded. That had been her own innermost
desire. She was glad he made the suggestion
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
himself. Before coming away he had leased
a house in Maida Vale, and had given instructions
to Liberty&#8217;s to furnish it. It would be
pleasanter there, in the midst of friends, than
planted away in the wilds of Devonshire with a
&#8220;cowpuncher.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='minor' />

<p>The months that followed were purgatory to
Jim. Once or twice he ran up to the club, where
he heard things that were not conducive to a
happy state of mind. Angela was entertaining
on a lavish scale. Cholmondeley told him of the
extraordinary &#8220;success&#8221; of his wife&#8217;s parties.
According to Cholmondeley every other hostess
was completely outshone by the beautiful
Angela, whose photograph was now an almost
permanent feature in the daily press.</p>
<p>It was on one of these visits that he met
Claude. The latter shook hands with him
heartily, but seemed ill at ease.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong, young feller?&#8221; queried Jim.</p>
<p>Claude passed off the question with a laugh.
Later, however he came to Jim.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Jim looked at him from under his eyebrows.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Look here, Jim,&#8221; said Claude impetuously,
&#8220;can&#8217;t you make it up with Angela? It seems
silly to prolong a quarrel.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh!&#8221;</p>
<p>The ejaculation made Claude start.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, whatever you quarreled about, it can&#8217;t
be much. Come along and see her now.&#8221;</p>
<p>His frank smile dissipated any suspicions in
Jim&#8217;s mind. Claude actually didn&#8217;t know what
was wrong with the Conlans! He believed it to
be a mere marital squabble, that would blow over
sooner or later.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kid,&#8221; gasped Jim, &#8220;you are the pink limit!
I guess there ain&#8217;t nothing that would stop
Angela from regarding me as unsifted muck,
just as she has since the first time I saw her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you didn&#8217;t know. Wal, it&#8217;s all in the
family, and you may as well git wise to it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But she&#8217;s&mdash;she&#8217;s your wife&mdash;&mdash;!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yep.... Don&#8217;t hurry, youngster. Get it
right back and masticate it well. They&#8217;ve fine
heads for business in your family, not to mention
play-acting.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span></p>
<p>Claude flushed. He stood up and gripped a
chair by the back.</p>
<p>&#8220;Steady,&#8221; said Jim. &#8220;I&#8217;m telling you the
truth.... But I thought you knew.&#8221;</p>
<p>Claude was realizing it fast enough.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then there was no quarrel?&#8221; he gasped.
&#8220;She&mdash;she simply left you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I told her she might&mdash;and she did. But you
needn&#8217;t worry none, I&#8217;ve staked bad claims
afore.&#8221;</p>
<p>Claude came over to him, much affected by the
deep emotion that had crept into his voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jim, I didn&#8217;t know. I swear I didn&#8217;t know.
I warned you because I didn&#8217;t believe she could
love and respect you as you deserve. But when I
heard you were engaged I believed you had
melted her in a strange way.... I see now
where the money came from.... God! and she
was mean enough to do that&mdash;to my&mdash;my
friend.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim took him by the shoulder and steadied
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;She saved your people from a big financial
crash, anyway&mdash;remember that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that any mitigation? I&#8217;d rather die in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
gutter than live on money that was obtained by a
vulgar fraud. She acted a lie&mdash;a damned despicable
lie. That sort of thing is done every day,
but the man usually knows what he is doing, and
hasn&#8217;t any scruples, and the girl sometimes learns
to love him.... So we&#8217;re living on the benevolence
and innocence of a man who isn&#8217;t good
enough to be the <i>real</i> husband of a Featherstone.
I wish to God my name were Smith or Jones&mdash;or
anything that is honest....&#8221;</p>
<p>He broke away from Jim, humiliated by the
knowledge that had come to him. On the morrow
he dropped in at the club, his face set in a way
strange to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I dropped in to say good-bye, Jim.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We had it all out last night&mdash;a real family
gathering. I think I got a little militant. Anyhow,
it&#8217;s better this way. What sort of chance is
there for a chap like me in Canada, Jim?&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim put down his newspaper and stared.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t mean that, kid.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do. I leave Liverpool this evening.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim stood up and took his hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon you&#8217;ll do,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But how&#8217;s the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span>
bank? You wouldn&#8217;t like a kind o&#8217; sleeping
partner on a fifty-fifty basis, eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>Claude shook his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know what you mean, Jim. But I&#8217;ve money
enough to get started at something. If ever I
get a partner out there, I shall consider myself
lucky if he&#8217;s half the man you are.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim sighed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish I was coming too.... You&#8217;re sure
about the dough? Come, I&#8217;d like to invest a little
in a real promising proposition. Say five thousand&mdash;jest
a small interest&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Claude gripped his hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a real brick, Jim, but it can&#8217;t be done.
No, I can&#8217;t stay to lunch. I&#8217;ve got one or two
calls to make. Good-bye.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-bye.&#8221;</p>
<p>He was about to leave when he turned again.</p>
<p>&#8220;You mustn&#8217;t mind me saying this, Jim.
Meredith is seeing a great deal too much of
Angela. There is doubtless nothing in it, but&mdash;well,
Angela is my sister, and I don&#8217;t like
Meredith.&#8221;</p>
<p>When he had gone Jim sat and pondered over
the words. A similar hint had been dropped by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span>
Cholmondeley. So Angela was already considered
fair spoil by men like Meredith! Meredith
was out to win the love that he had lost.
It rankled&mdash;it hurt. But behind his fury there
lurked the sinister shadow of defeat and humiliation.
There were giddy heights to which he could
not climb, and to which Meredith was soaring&mdash;Meredith,
a man he could have taken in his own
hands and broken; a cheat, armed with every
weapon that culture could forge, and little
else.</p>
<p>In the evening he summoned up his failing
courage and went to Angela&#8217;s house. It was one
blaze of light and one tumult of sound. A
dapper footman opened the door and took his
card. He waited in the hall, running his eyes
over the rich decorations. From higher up the
hall came sounds of revelry, and now and again
he caught sight of figures flitting to and fro.
The sound of a string band drifted down to
him, and then laughter&mdash;cultured, high-toned
laughter that grated on his nerves.</p>
<p>When eventually he was shown into the drawing-room,
he wished he hadn&#8217;t come. Angela
was one blaze of glory. Her guests bowed to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
him in a fashion that was intended, and succeeded,
to make their superiority felt. Angela
was cool and remarkably self-possessed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was passing and jest dropped in,&#8221; he explained.</p>
<p>&#8220;That was very nice of you. Will you take
anything to drink?&#8221;</p>
<p>He shook his head negatively. He only
wanted to get away from these people. They
were too polite to whisper to each other, but their
silence was eloquent enough. They were laughing
in their sleeves at this unfortunate husband.
A figure dawdled up, and bowing, took Angela&#8217;s
arm with a smirking smile. It was Meredith.</p>
<p>It was a pleasure to breathe the fresher air outside.
Jim caught the next train to Devonshire,
feeling like a dog that has been kicked by its mistress.
He arrived home to find a pile of bills&mdash;debts
incurred by Angela&mdash;awaiting him. He
glared at them, half inclined to return them and
repudiate responsibility. But he didn&#8217;t. He
wrote numerous checks for considerable sums
and sent them away.</p>
<p>&#8220;What a pace! But it&#8217;s got to stop. God,
why can&#8217;t I get a holt on myself. Jim, you ain&#8217;t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
a man. They&#8217;re putting you through your paces
like a circus dog, and you&#8217;re taking it all lying
down.&#8221;</p>
<p>He jammed on his hat and went striding out
into the country.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h3>THE CLIMAX</h3>
</div>

<p>The months passed and a New Year was
ushered in. The lonely man at Little
Badholme wondered what it held for
him. He had seen Angela only once since the
evening when he had called on her. She was
riding in the Row with Meredith. She had not
seen Jim, but Meredith had, and smiled to himself
as though he was pleasantly conscious of the
pangs he gave the former.</p>
<p>It was after breakfast one morning that the
newspaper brought amazing news to Little Badholme.
The first piece of news was to the effect
that gold had been discovered in big quantities
in the Klondyke, and that a vast stampede was
taking place. The second was of far greater importance,
so far as Jim was concerned. It was
announced in a comparatively small headline,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
but it leaped out to him as he casually glanced
over the columns.</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto; '><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>BIG CRASH ON THE STOCK EXCHANGE.</p>

<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>AMAZON COPPER COMPANY ABSCOND.</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>It came as a shock to him. But a few months
since he had invested all his money in the
Amazon Company! He ran to the telephone
and got through to his broker. The reply was
what he expected; the Company had gone
smash without hope of recovery, the shares were
not worth the paper on which they were written.
He put up the receiver and sat down to think
things over. He was broke. Save for his small
bank balance and the house over his head, he had
nothing in the world.</p>
<p>He laughed grimly as he reflected upon his
meteoric career. In the meantime there was
Angela spending as though money came from
some eternal fountain! He frowned as he remembered
the precious checks that had been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
paid during the past few months, checks that
had reduced his liquid cash reserve to a mere
fragment. Though he was unwilling to confess
it, it gave him a certain amount of joy to anticipate
her fall to earth when she realized that the
lavish entertaining must cease&mdash;that the source
of the magic spring had suddenly dried up.</p>
<p>He took the next train to London, dined at the
club, and then prepared to break the news to
Angela.</p>
<hr class='minor' />

<p>At that moment the adorable Angela was
receiving a friend. Hilary Meredith, spotlessly
garbed, was lounging in the drawing-room,
drinking in the strains of a Chopin Nocturne.
Not only were his ears gladdened by romantic
music, but his eyes were equally exercised by the
radiant figure of Angela, bending over the piano,
with the red-shaded lights throwing her bare
shoulders into perspective and turning her hair
to liquid gold. The nocturne ended, she swung
round on Meredith.</p>
<p>&#8220;How did you like that, Hilary?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Superb&mdash;dark avenues on a June night, with
odorous breezes and the lap of the sea on the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
beach below&mdash;and you, Angela&mdash;always you,
dreaming in the moonlight.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be absurd! Why should I dream in the
moonlight? And what should I dream?&#8221;</p>
<p>He looked at her from under his long eyelashes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of Love, perhaps&mdash;who knows?&#8221;</p>
<p>She shrugged her shoulders.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think not.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it then so odious to you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps.&#8221;</p>
<p>He flung the end of his cigarette into the fireplace
and, standing up, walked across to her.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are dazzlingly beautiful to-night,
Angela.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You say that almost every night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not? A truth cannot too often be
reiterated.&#8221;</p>
<p>She ran her white fingers over the notes of the
piano, producing a rippling arpeggio that was
like running water.</p>
<p>&#8220;Compliments are cheap.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You think that is a mere compliment? No,
you know it isn&#8217;t. You know I love you madly,
desperately, Angela. Let us cease this&mdash;acting.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
Aren&#8217;t we made for each other? I&#8217;m tired of
London&mdash;tired of everything but you.&#8221;</p>
<p>She stopped playing and sat perfectly still.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t you a little impatient, Hilary? You
seem to forget I have a husband.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Husband!&#8221; he laughed loudly. &#8220;I thought
you, too, had forgotten that by this time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it must be an unpleasant memory&mdash;the
most beautiful woman in London wedded to a
cowpuncher! Angela, are you going to waste
your life tied to an undesirable? Here is love
and devotion waiting.... I haven&#8217;t all the gold
in the universe, but doesn&#8217;t breeding count?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hilary, you are talking the veriest nonsense.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Am I? Then why did you ask me here to-night?
You knew I would talk this nonsense,
and yet you asked me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was lonely&mdash;that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>
<p>She stood up and pushed the stool aside. Her
shoulder came up against him. In a moment he
seized her arm and held her in a passionate
embrace.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hilary!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Angela. It&#8217;s got to be to-night&mdash;or never.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
I&#8217;ve waited until I can wait no longer. I&#8217;ll call
for you in an hour&#8217;s time, and we can catch the
midnight train&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>She tried to push him away, but he clung on
desperately.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s impossible!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;Please let me
go.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Angela&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Meredith suddenly stopped. His arms fell to
his side. Standing just inside the door was Jim
Conlan. Angela turned and saw him too&mdash;a
great grim figure, with head thrust forward and
hands on hips.</p>
<p>&#8220;How did you get here?&#8221; she demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your powdered monkey outside got obstinate.
Said you weren&#8217;t at home. Seems as though he
made some error.&#8221;</p>
<p>He came down the room and planted himself
opposite Meredith. He raised one arm and
pointed to the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Get out!&#8221; he snapped.</p>
<p>Meredith looked at Angela. He would have
been glad to get out just then, but he wasn&#8217;t
anxious for Angela to be conscious of that desire.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you get me?&mdash;get out!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span></p>
<p>Meredith fidgeted. Then to his horror Angela
said slowly:</p>
<p>&#8220;I beg that you will stay, Mr. Meredith.&#8221;</p>
<p>The latter began to retreat to the settee. But
he never got there. He felt a hand of steel grip
him by the shoulder, and looked round to find a
pair of infuriated eyes blazing down on him.</p>
<p>&#8220;You ain&#8217;t wanted here, you dirty tinhorn!&#8221;
yelled Jim. He ran him to the door, opened it,
and then shot him into the passage. When he
came back Angela was standing exactly in the
same place. Her face was white with indignation.</p>
<p>&#8220;How dare you&mdash;you brute!&#8221; she said. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
have you put out!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sit down!&#8221; thundered Jim.</p>
<p>It was the first time he had ever addressed her
in that way and she felt decidedly uncomfortable.
She dropped leisurely on to a chair.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now then, listen! I&#8217;ve got my wind back
agin. Oh, I ain&#8217;t going to start&mdash;recriminations&mdash;<i>some</i>
word, that! It&#8217;s plain business between
me and you. In the first place, we&#8217;re
broke. Did you git that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Stoney&mdash;clean bust. Wal, money never did
cut much ice with me, but it did with you.
You&#8217;ve squandered a hell of a lot of money on
things that didn&#8217;t matter, and now here&#8217;s old
man Ruin come to say How-do.&#8221;</p>
<p>Angela regarded him in astonishment.</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean to say&mdash;you&#8217;ve lost all your
money?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh no. I only lost some of it. You lost the
other. Don&#8217;t talk. I don&#8217;t suppose you have any
notion of what you&#8217;ve spent in less than six
months. Anyway, it&#8217;s done, and squealing won&#8217;t
help matters.... I jest came to tell you to
pack up. Me and you&#8217;s going to make some
more money.&#8221;</p>
<p>She jumped up.</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you talking about?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You will pack a box or two with things that
are essential for a trip to Alaska.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Alaska!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jest that. We&#8217;re joining the stampede&mdash;you
and me. I&#8217;ll call for you to-morrow morning at
ten. Stampedes don&#8217;t allow for no waste time.
First come first served.&#8221;</p>
<p>She suddenly burst into laughter. The whole
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
thing was so ridiculous. He imagined she was
going to accompany him into the frozen wastes of
Alaska to dig gold. It was excruciatingly funny.
But when she looked again at him she didn&#8217;t feel
like repeating the laugh. She had never seen
such fixity of purpose in any man&#8217;s expression.
He seemed to have added more inches to his
colossal height.</p>
<p>&#8220;You must be mad!&#8221; she said. &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry
you have lost the money, but&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll be ready at ten o&#8217;clock to-morrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>She saw he was in deadly earnest, but believed
he was overreaching himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;At any rate, let us talk sense,&#8221; she said coldly.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll find I&#8217;m talking sense all right. I&#8217;m
through with any other kind of talk,&#8221; he replied.
&#8220;I&#8217;m making the Klondyke. Ain&#8217;t it natural for
a man to take his wife with him&mdash;even though
she&#8217;s only a bought wife?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You talk as though I might be fool enough to
come. Understand, once and for all, I refuse to
go anywhere with you. Please leave me.&#8221;</p>
<p>He took up his hat.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be round to-morrow. Get them bags
packed, or you&#8217;ll come without them.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You are not in Colorado now,&#8221; she said
icily. &#8220;You can&#8217;t abduct women by force in
London.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess you&#8217;ll find I can,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;Good-night!&#8221;</p>
<p>After he had gone she sat down and thought
the matter over. The financial catastrophe appalled
her. She had grown so used to a life of
luxury. And the threat? It seemed fantastic,
impossible of fulfillment. Never in her life had
she been coerced by force. There was one way
out&mdash;Meredith&#8217;s way. But she could not bring
herself to take that course. Meredith had never
succeeded in arousing the slightest passion within
her. He had been merely a plaything&mdash;a simpering,
compliment-throwing nincompoop of a
type that most society women felt a need for, as
food for their vanity. She decided that the most
sensible plan would be to spend the next day with
her people.</p>
<hr class='minor' />

<p>Jim arrived at ten o&#8217;clock precisely, in a cab,
with a single bag of luggage. The footman, who
had already suffered once at Jim&#8217;s hands, tremblingly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
vouchsafed the news that Mrs. Conlan
was out.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s she gone?&#8221;</p>
<p>He didn&#8217;t know. She went out very early and
had said she might not return that day.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell her maid to get some clothes packed up
for her mistress&mdash;strong ones. Have &#8217;em ready
in an hour.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man stared.</p>
<p>&#8220;Beat it!&#8221; growled Jim, &#8220;or I&#8217;ll come and
superintend it myself. If they&#8217;re not ready when
I come back, watch out for trouble!&#8221;</p>
<p>He ran down the steps and told the driver to
drive to Lord Featherstone&#8217;s house. Instinctively
he guessed Angela&#8217;s port of refuge. Arriving
there, a burly footman told him that His
Lordship was not at home. The next instant
Jim was in the hall. The second flunkey looked
at the first. They had received strict instructions
that Mr. Conlan was not to be admitted. They
both came to the conclusion that physical obstruction
in this case was tantamount to suicide.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lead the way,&#8221; said Jim.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sir&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Lead the way, you powdered nanny-goats!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span></p>
<p>Ultimately he arrived at the drawing-room
door. He knocked loudly and entered. Angela
was sitting reading. Lady Featherstone was
doing likewise, and His Lordship was standing
before the fire with his hands in his pockets.</p>
<p>&#8220;Conlan!&#8221; gasped the latter. &#8220;How dare you
come here?&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim fixed his eyes on Angela, who had closed
the book and was regarding him in amazement.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve come,&#8221; he said grimly. &#8220;Get your
clothes on.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What is the meaning of this?&#8221; asked Featherstone.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve come to remove my property,&#8221; said Jim.
&#8220;You didn&#8217;t think I was hiking to the Klondyke
and leaving fifty thousand pounds&#8217; worth of
property lying about, did you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Featherstone felt the jibe, but he was furious
at the intrusion. Jim turned to Angela.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m waiting,&#8221; he snapped.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better go,&#8221; she reported. &#8220;You merely
succeed in making a fool of yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh dear!&#8221; moaned Lady Featherstone.
&#8220;The man is dangerous. Claude, call John
and Henry.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yep, call in your tame leopards. Gee&mdash;I&#8217;m
starving for a fight!&#8221;</p>
<p>Featherstone, eyeing this six-feet-three of hard
knotted muscle, attempted to bring diplomacy to
the rescue.</p>
<p>&#8220;Conlan,&#8221; he pleaded, &#8220;I beg you to act
reasonably. I understand you are going to the
Klondyke. But you can scarcely expect Angela
to accompany you there. There are certain limits
to a wife&#8217;s marital responsibilities.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim&#8217;s eyes narrowed.</p>
<p>&#8220;There ain&#8217;t no sentiments in business. I
bought her for fifty thousand. I&#8217;m not writing
off anything for depreciation, cos I allow there
ain&#8217;t no depreciation, in a material sense. I&#8217;m
jest hanging on to my property till I can get a
price that leaves a margin of profit&mdash;say ten per
cent. Make the bidding and I&#8217;ll quit.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nothing was more calculated to arouse
Featherstone&#8217;s unbridled wrath.</p>
<p>&#8220;You vulgar cowpuncher!&#8221; he retorted. &#8220;You
dare insult me in that way! You dare treat my
daughter as bag and baggage&mdash;to be sold at
auction like an Asiatic slave&mdash;&mdash;!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I made the offer,&#8221; said Jim casually, &#8220;because
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
I thought, from experience, that was your
line of business.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Leave my house!&#8221; stormed Featherstone.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sartenly. Angela, come on, we ain&#8217;t
wanted.&#8221;</p>
<p>Angela sat like a statue. Suddenly Jim
sprang to action.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m giving you two minutes,&#8221; he snapped.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you ain&#8217;t ready then I&#8217;ll carry you out.
And if any guy tries buttin&#8217; in, wal&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Lady Featherstone gave a shriek of terror.</p>
<p>&#8220;Call the police,&#8221; she wailed.</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear Conlan&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; commenced His Lordship.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m through with talking. One minute
gone!&#8221;</p>
<p>Angela stood up.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not coming to Alaska,&#8221; she said defiantly,
&#8220;but I&#8217;ll come with you out of this house, to save
my mother and father further annoyance and
insult.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim walked to the door and held it open.</p>
<p>&#8220;We leave for Liverpool at five o&#8217;clock to-morrow
morning,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>She got her hat and coat and walked majestically
to the cab.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h3>THE WHITE TRAIL</h3>
</div>

<p>It was a &#8220;squaw man&#8221; rejoicing in the name
of &#8220;Slick George&#8221; who first revealed the
magic wealth of the Klondyke. Whilst
making a fire on a small creek now known to the
world as Bonanza Creek wherewith to cook his
evening meal, he thawed out some of the frozen
gravel, and, in the manner of the born prospector,
carelessly washed it, to find himself the possessor
of nearly a thousand dollars in raw gold.</p>
<p>Making Forty Mile with a view to dissipating
his newly found wealth in a gormandizing &#8220;jag,&#8221;
he sent the settlers in that ramshackle camp into
wild excitement by producing nuggets of a size
hitherto unmatched.</p>
<p>In a few hours Forty Mile was a deserted
place. Every able-bodied man, and not a few
others, responded to the lure of gold with an
alacrity that was remarkable. Anything that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span>
would float was pushed into the muddy Yukon,
and poled up the fifty-two miles river to the new
Eldorado.</p>
<p>The news spread with the speed amazing in so
sparsely populated a country. From all the
townships lying on the banks of the Yukon, from
Sitka and from the Canadian borderland, came
endless processions&mdash;good men, bad men, women
and children&mdash;all with the gold-lust overleaping
any other considerations.</p>
<p>Dawson, the center of all this itinerant
humanity, grew from a struggling camp on a
frozen muskeg to a teeming Babylon. The strike
proved to be genuine. Already tens of thousands
of dollars had been unearthed along some of the
smaller creeks. The price of commodities rose as
the population increased. When the Arctic winter
settled down, and the mountain-locked country
was frozen a hundred feet down from the
surface, the thousands who had made the journey
in ignorance of the conditions obtaining found
the food supply inadequate to meet the needs of
the wanderers. The law of Supply and Demand
operating, only the lucky stakers were able to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span>
pay the huge prices demanded for every single
commodity.</p>
<p>The news filtered through to the outer world.
From the Eastern States and the Pacific Slope,
from far-away Europe, came more wanderers.
Late in their quest, but hopeful nevertheless,
they prepared for the terrible journey over the
Chilcoot Pass and down across the frozen lakes
to the land of gold.</p>
<p>At Dyea thousands were struggling to get
over the Pass. Women and children and dogs
and Indians constituted the human octopus
spread out over the snow at the mouth of the
Dyea Cañon, which is the entrance to the Pass.
Rearing above them was the white precipitous
peak over which every pound of their gear and
food had to be packed.</p>
<p>Included in this crowd were two familiar
figures&mdash;an immense man, looking even more
immense in his bearskin parkha, and a woman,
garbed in similar fashion, whose faces were set
and cold. They folded up their tent as the first
light of the morn struck the white pinnacle above,
and packed it with the other multitudinous
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span>
things that formed a dump on the snow beside
them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Got to make the passage now. There&#8217;s wind
coming,&#8221; said Jim.</p>
<p>Angela said nothing. She had got beyond
repartee. The immediate past was a nightmare,
filled with terrible journeying, close proximity
with the sweepings of the gutter, and sights that
at times almost froze the blood within her. And
yet the worst had not arrived! Twice she had
tried to escape from this enforced pilgrimage,
but had failed utterly. Jim had brought her back
by brute force. She became aware of the difficulties
that faced her. She was his wife&mdash;his
property. Had any modern Don Quixote felt
like rescuing a beautiful woman in distress, he
might well have hesitated at sight of the husband.
As civilization was left behind so the hope of
escape lessened.</p>
<p>Her brain swam as she beheld this terrifying
thing over which she was expected&mdash;nay, compelled&mdash;to
travel. Yet other women were doing
it&mdash;women with children in their arms! But
perhaps they loved the men they accompanied,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
whilst she&mdash;&mdash; She bit her lips as she looked at
the grim face of Jim.</p>
<p>All the gear had to be packed over that awful
height. Jim, anxious to save time, collared three
wiry Indians and bargained with them. For ten
cents a pound they were ready to pack the gear.
He agreed, and she saw them take on to their
backs an immense burden. Each of them carried
no less than 200 pounds. With these crushing
weights they were going to climb the dizzy path.
It was amazing!</p>
<p>The Indians having started, Jim began to
strap the rest of the packages about him.
Despite her hate, she could not but feel a sense of
admiration. When she thought his back was
about to break he still added more, grunting as he
took up the packages. All but a sack of beans
found lodgment on that huge body. The latter
he placed into her hands.</p>
<p>&#8220;Take that,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>She hesitated, and then took it, carrying it in
her arms as she might a child.</p>
<p>&#8220;Better shoulder it,&#8221; he growled.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can carry it better this way,&#8221; she retorted.</p>
<p>He said no more but began the ascent. In a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span>
few minutes she found herself almost exhausted.
She moved the sack to her shoulder and found
this method much easier.</p>
<p>Looking at it from the base, the Chilcoot had
been terrifying enough, but on the slope it was a
thousand times worse. She remembered a conversation
between Jim and a man on the steamer
who had made the ascent many times.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, is this Chilcoot as husky a thing as they
make out?&#8221; queried Jim.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wal, stranger, I calculated it would be
steepish, but darn me if I thought it would lean
back!&#8221; the other had replied.</p>
<p>She was beginning to realize how nearly true
this was. She had made up her mind she would
not give way to the terrific fear that gripped her.
She hated to think that she might appear contemptible
in his eyes. But the last thousand feet
broke all her resolutions. It shot up in one unbroken,
dizzy ascent. She saw the Indians, like
black ants, climbing and resting alternately. She
took a few faltering steps, looked down and
shivered. Far below was the black train of
climbers, reaching away as far as the eye could
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span>
see. But above&mdash;she dare not risk that awful
path. She sat down.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t do it!&#8221; she cried.</p>
<p>Jim turned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t&mdash;I can&#8217;t!&#8221;</p>
<p>He came down to her, slipping and sliding on
the frozen snow.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a big wind coming. You&#8217;ll be blown
off if you stay here.&#8221;</p>
<p>He caught her fingers with his one free hand
and began to climb. Step by step they proceeded.
Her heart felt cold within her. The
Indians had disappeared over the top. It must
be flat there, she thought!</p>
<p>A few snowflakes began to fall, and a sullen
roar came from the north.</p>
<p>&#8220;The blizzard!&#8221; growled Jim.</p>
<p>He hastened the pace, dragging her now. The
roar increased. The sky to the north and east
was inky black. Below them several parties were
hastily dumping their packs on the snow and
preparing to meet this Arctic monster....
They arrived at the summit at the same moment
as the blizzard. She saw a whirling mass of snow,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span>
heard a roar like ten thousand demons let loose,
and felt the strong grip of Jim pulling her down
on the snow.</p>
<p>For an hour it raged. It was beyond her
wildest imagination. Never had she beheld or
even conceived anything so utterly merciless and
devastating. Great masses of snow were lifted
from the mountain-top and driven before the
almost solid wind. It lashed her few inches of
exposed flesh, until she found the antidote by
placing her heavy mittens before her face and
burying her head close to the ground.</p>
<p>Then it lifted, and the sun shone in dazzling
radiance from a frozen sky. The packs and the
party were white as the landscape that yawned
away on all sides. Before them was a slope as
precipitous as that they had just negotiated&mdash;but
it went <i>down</i>. The Indians dug out their packs
and, taking their pay, went on in search of further
jobs.</p>
<p>Angela wondered how Jim was going to negotiate
the dizzy downward path. It ran almost
perpendicularly to Crater Lake, beyond which it
was easier going.</p>
<p>Jim took the big sled to the top of the slide,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>
and commenced to dump the various packages on
to it. With a coil of hemp rope he lashed this
load into one compact mass. It hung on the
sheer edge of a precipice, ready for instant flight.
The meaning of it suddenly came to her.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&mdash;you aren&#8217;t going to slide down?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I jest am,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Sit you down there.&#8221;</p>
<p>Reluctantly she obeyed, clinging tightly to the
knotted rope. She saw him give the sled a
violent push and jump aboard. It started down
the incline, gathering momentum at a dreadful
rate. In twenty seconds it was rushing onward
like a cannon-ball raising the snow and shrieking
as it went.... The speed eventually decreased.
They passed the frozen lake and made for Linderman,
Jim dragging the sled and Angela pushing
on the gee-pole.</p>
<p>After that it was a nightmare. Angela&#8217;s impression
was of one endless white wilderness,
broken only by a network of frozen lakes and occasional
icy precipices. At nights they pitched
their tent amid the vast loneliness, banking it
with snow to keep out the freezing cold. At
times they were held up for days, confined to the
evil-smelling tent with a blizzard blowing outside.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span>
The oilstove was a blessing, despite its sickening
odor, and only the piled-up snow kept the small
tent from being blown to ribbons. It was little
more than an Esquimo igloo.</p>
<p>When the wind went this merciless husband
downed the tent, packed up, and was off again
into the wilderness&mdash;and there were 400 miles of
this! The glare of the sun on the white snow
blinded her, until she accepted the snow goggles
which she had at first indignantly refused. The
stillness frightened her. Never had she imagined
such terrible soul-torturing silence; at times she
asked questions merely for the pleasure of hearing
a human voice. When they overtook some
struggling party the desire to stop and talk was
all-consuming. But Jim wasn&#8217;t for wasting time
in useless conversation.</p>
<p>She hated him for that. She hated him for all
the agony and pain that he had brought her.
Fits of uncontrollable anger possessed her. She
gave vent to her feelings in bitter rebuke. It had
some effect, too. She knew it hurt him by the
queer light in his eyes, but he said nothing&mdash;which
made her angrier still.</p>
<p>He had become even more silent than she.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
One thing, however, he did regularly. When
they partook of the evening meal&mdash;a sickly concoction
of beans and coffee, or canned meat, and
nestled down inside the bearskin sleeping-bags
beside the eternal oilstove, his deep voice
growled:</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-night, Angela!&#8221;</p>
<p>Sometimes she responded and sometimes she
did not. But it made no difference&mdash;the &#8220;Good-night&#8221;
was always uttered.</p>
<p>The last stage of the journey was a fight with
time. They struck the Yukon River and went
down over the sloppy ice. The break-up was
coming, and Dawson was eighty miles away.
Despite her bitter feelings she found excitement
in the combat. At any moment the ice might
split with thundering noise and go smashing
down to the sea, piling up in vast pyramids as
it went. Each morning they expected to wake
and find the ice in movement.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;ll hold,&#8221; cried Jim. &#8220;Another twenty
miles and we&#8217;re through!&#8221;</p>
<p>So they plowed their way to the Eldorado of
the North. It was when they were but three
miles from Dawson that the break-up came. It
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span>
was heralded by ear-splitting explosions. Jim
put all his weight on to the sled.</p>
<p>&#8220;She won&#8217;t move much yet,&#8221; he growled.
&#8220;Mush on!&#8221;</p>
<p>For another mile they kept the river trail, and
then with deafening crashes from behind them
the whole ice began to move. No time was to be
lost now. Jim dragged the sled inland and made
the bank at a suitable landing.</p>
<hr class='minor' />

<p>An hour later they made Dawson City. The
streets were filled with half-melted snow,
through which a mixed humanity trudged, laden
with all kinds of gear and provisions. Tents
were pitched on every available piece of land.
Saloons were filled with mobs clamoring for
drink and food. Around the Yukon agent&#8217;s
office were crowds waiting to register &#8220;claims&#8221;
that might or might not make their owners millionaires.
All the creeks within miles of Dawson
had been staked long since, and late-comers were
staking likely spots further afield. News came
of rich yields in some barren God-forsaken place
and immediately a stampede was made for it.</p>
<p>Angela, who had pined for any kind of civilization
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
rather than a continuance of the eternal
snows, wondered if this were any better. Jim
pitched the tent under some spruce-trees and
high up on a bluff beyond the city.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wal, we&#8217;re here,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she replied bitterly. &#8220;You&#8217;ve got so
far. And what next?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re going to git gold. Yep, we sure are&mdash;and
you&#8217;re going to help.&#8221;</p>
<p>She shut her mouth grimly. This was a big
city; there were men here going back to civilization
after making their fortunes. In a few weeks
the river would be free and steamers would be
making Vancouver. It oughtn&#8217;t to be so difficult
to find someone who would help her to escape
from a man like this!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h3>HIGH STAKES</h3>
</div>

<p>Before many days had passed Angela
realized how wisely Jim had traded in
Vancouver. At the time she had wondered
why he had been so prodigal in the matter
of food. It seemed to her sheer lunacy to travel
over icy mountains with what appeared to be
enough food for a traveling circus. Now she
saw that but for his foresight they might have
felt the fine edge of starvation as others were
doing.</p>
<p>With remarkable suddenness the cold had
vanished and the thermometer mounted daily.
A dank, warm atmosphere embraced the country.
Under the vanishing snow were green
buds that burst into bloom at the first direct rays
of the sun. An unwelcome visitor invaded the
camp&mdash;the mosquito. He rose from the swampy
river in myriads, and made life a torture.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span></p>
<p>Jim had got his usual hustle on. Very quickly
he became a popular figure in the town. But
two days after his arrival he met an old friend&mdash;a
gaunt, lanky figure, with a beard a foot long.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, darn me if it ain&#8217;t Colorado Jim!&#8221;</p>
<p>He turned and saw Dan, late owner of the
Medicine Bow Hotel, looking wonderfully prosperous
and happy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, Dan!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gosh, you ain&#8217;t altered none. Come and hev&#8217;
some poison.&#8221;</p>
<p>They pushed their way into a crowded saloon,
and Dan flung down a small poke of gold-dust
for a bottle of whisky, from which he received no
change.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s your lay, Jim?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Prospectin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wal, yore sure a queer cuss. Why in hell
d&#8217;ye want to go prospectin&#8217; with a million of the
best in the bank?&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m broke, Dan.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yep. An&#8217; I&#8217;m married.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span></p>
<p>Dan nearly choked. Then he clapped his hand
on his leg and roared with delight.</p>
<p>&#8220;Married. Wal, I guess she&#8217;s a lucky gal,
even if you are bust. But how&#8217;d it happen?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bad speculation. But I&#8217;m through with that.
See here, Dan, I&#8217;m wantin&#8217; to stake a couple of
claims, but every darn piece of dirt seems pegged
out.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dan stroked his beard.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yore late. I got wise to what it&#8217;d be like, so
I hiked up here early. Staked twenty-two on
Bonanza and sold out yesterday to the Syndicate.
Five hundred thousand I got, and never thawed
out more&#8217;n a square yard of dirt. And now I&#8217;m
mushing for the bright lights.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim&#8217;s face contracted.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope you&#8217;ll like &#8217;em, Dan. They sure gave
me the croup. Maybe I ain&#8217;t built that way, and
you are. &#8217;Pears to me that the Klondyke is a
mission-hall compared to London or New York.
They&#8217;ll take the gold filling from yore false teeth
out there.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dan surveyed him carefully.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong, Jim? You seem kinder
moody like. Someone kicked you in the hip?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You got it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wal, I guess you&#8217;ll git over it,&#8221; said Dan
philosophically. &#8220;Mebbe you&#8217;d like me to take
some message back, eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She ain&#8217;t back there,&#8221; said Jim. &#8220;She&#8217;s
right here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dan looked as though he had been shot.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that? You ain&#8217;t telling me&mdash;&mdash;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a hell of a place for ladies.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim frowned. He knew that perfectly well.
Now and again a feeling of self-reproach came,
but he strangled it by reflecting upon the trick
that had been played upon him. After all, he
had bought her at her own price, and he meant
to keep her.</p>
<p>Two or three of Dan&#8217;s lucky friends were
scanning Jim&#8217;s enormous figure with obvious
interest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, boys, &#8217;member I told you about a husky
guy at Medicine Bow who made a pile and sold
out?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wal, this is him all right. Ain&#8217;t he a beaut?&#8221;</p>
<p>They shook hands with Jim and ordered more
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
whisky. Like Dan they were overburdened with
money, and remarkably free with it. They were
beguiling the time in innocent &#8220;jags&#8221; pending
the arrival of the boat in the river that was to
take them out of the Klondyke.</p>
<p>&#8220;Looking for a claim?&#8221; inquired one of them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thet&#8217;s so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothin&#8217; doing this side of Blackwater, but
there&#8217;s a dinky little creek five mile up-river.
What do they call that creek where Dave staked,
Whitey?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Red Ruin,&#8221; replied Whitey.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yep, Red Ruin. There&#8217;s a mile or so at the
lower end unstaked, and if there ain&#8217;t gold there,
my name ain&#8217;t what it is. Dave staked 250 feet
yesterday, and he&#8217;s sure nuts on gold.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dan nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;You hike there, Jim, afore it goes to someone
else.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ain&#8217;t a healthy sort of name&mdash;Red Ruin,&#8221;
said Jim with a laugh.</p>
<p>&#8220;Names don&#8217;t count.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim was finally persuaded to try his luck there.
He left the party, followed by their best wishes
for success, and made for the camp up the hill.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
He found Angela in a fit of revolt. She had done
nothing since he left that morning. Dirty pans
and dishes littered the ground and blankets were
lying in heaps all round.</p>
<p>&#8220;Angela!&#8221;</p>
<p>She looked at him.</p>
<p>&#8220;You ain&#8217;t bin hustling overmuch.&#8221;</p>
<p>She flared up in an instant.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sick of this. You brought me here by
brute force. I won&#8217;t go on with it. Do you
understand? I&#8217;ve tramped over that icy wilderness
with you. I&#8217;ve suffered until I can suffer no
longer. You never were a gentleman, and
ordinary courtesy and respect for a woman are
unknown to you, but surely you have a heart
somewhere within you. Can&#8217;t you see this is
killing me? Do you want to break my heart?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hearts are hearts, ain&#8217;t they? And breaking
one ain&#8217;t no worse than breaking another.
No, I&#8217;m no gentleman&mdash;not the kind you bin
used to. That&#8217;s why I came here&mdash;because here
they&#8217;re only men, and I&#8217;d jest as soon be a man
as anything else on earth. I reckon that where a
man goes his woman should go too.&#8221;</p>
<p>She flushed at the appellation &#8220;woman.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You talk like a barbarian. I&#8217;m not your
woman&mdash;you understand? Not your woman.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Figure out how you may,&#8221; he retorted,
&#8220;when you buy a thing, you buy it, and it&#8217;s yours
until someone pays you to git it, or someone is
hefty enough to take it from you. As for that,
if any guy thinks about cuttin&#8217; in, he&#8217;s welcome
to try.&#8221;</p>
<p>The true sense of his position was made patent.
His rough philosophy was good. Had she been
his by mere conquest, no man in the Klondyke
would have disputed it. Being his wife, legally,
his position was doubly strong. Only cunning
could win through. She meant to exercise that
faculty as soon as opportunity presented itself.
And the opportunity was close at hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going up-river to-morrow,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;to prospect a creek, and to stake two claims if
it&#8217;s a promising place. I&#8217;ll be back before sundown....
Ain&#8217;t you goin&#8217; to git supper?&#8221;</p>
<p>She was on the point of refusing to carry out
the necessary abhorrent domestic work, but the
chance of escape which his words gave rise to
brought discretion to the forefront. She cooked
a dish of beans and opened some canned fruit,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
and they took their meal, thrusting it beneath
the shielding mosquito-nets which seldom left
their heads.</p>
<p>Half an hour later they made ready for sleep,
in very close proximity to the hard ground, with
a hanging canvas curtain between them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-night, Angela!&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>She returned no answer.</p>
<p>Down in the town things were just beginning
to wake up. No one worried about time in
Dawson City. The nights were like the days,
the only difference being that the nights were
more noisy. Time was stretched and manipulated
with as much ease as an elastic band. Men
went to bed at eight in the morning, and woke up
to take their breakfast at three or four in the
afternoon. Thereafter came dancing, drinking,
mirth, and boisterous song. The conditions of
the northern summer aided and abetted this
queer juggling with time, for it was never dark,
and 3 A.M. was not much different to 3 P.M. And
as a rule, the life of the saloons was too busy a
thing to take notice of any changes in the position
of the sun.</p>
<p>The next morning Jim, armed with a pick
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
and shovel and some stakes, left for Red Ruin.
Angela watched him disappear over a bluff, and
immediately prepared to put into operation her
scheme for escape. She packed a small sack with
the few things she would require, and wrote a
short note which she pinned to the flap of the
tent.</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>&#8220;I warned you I should go. There is no other
way but this.&mdash;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Angela.</span>&#8221;</p>
</div>
<p>She took the sack and descended to the
crowded town. The river was still belching ice
into the Bering Sea, but the last floes were leaving
the upper reaches, and she knew that in a few
hours navigation would be possible, up-stream.
Whilst many parties were content to wait for the
steamer&#8217;s arrival, others, less patient, were preparing
to &#8220;make out&#8221; up the river and lakes and
over the Chilcoot.</p>
<p>She began to put out a few furtive inquiries,
and secured the names of several men who were
preparing for immediate departure. She was
wise enough to take a look at these worthies before
committing herself to their charge, and
most of them did not please her. Wandering in
the back areas at noon, she noticed a rough shack
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span>
bearing an obviously new announcement &#8220;For
Sale.&#8221; Already a queue of prospective purchasers
was lining up. When the owner&mdash;a sallow
man of about fifty&mdash;appeared, he was besieged.
The shack was sold in a few minutes to
the highest bidder. Angela, nervous but determined,
interrogated the sallow man.</p>
<p>&#8220;Excuse me, but are you leaving?&#8221;</p>
<p>He ran his keen eyes over her, immediately
impressed by her beauty and her bearing.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Soon?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To-morrow morning if the river&#8217;s clear.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Alone?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No&mdash;two others.&#8221;</p>
<p>Angela breathed a sigh of relief. There was
safety in numbers.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to go to England&mdash;or to New York.
Will you take me? I&#8217;ve no money or food, but
I&#8217;ll pay you well when I get away.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man stared.</p>
<p>&#8220;As soon as I can cable to my people they will
send me money,&#8221; she resumed. &#8220;Take me as far
as the first cable station, and in forty-eight hours
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span>
I will get money to recompense you,&#8221; she added
quickly.</p>
<p>His brows contracted.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the hurry?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to get away from someone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah&mdash;I see.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you&mdash;will you take me? I&#8217;ll work.&#8221;</p>
<p>He looked at her soft, exquisite face and
figure, and grinned as he reflected that the work
she could do was negligible; but the suggestion
had its fascination. She was beautiful&mdash;and
beautiful women were rare in the Klondyke. He
opened the door of the shack and called &#8220;Tom!&#8221;
Tom appeared in his shirt-sleeves&mdash;a big awry
figure with a face like a chimpanzee.</p>
<p>&#8220;Got a grub-staker. What do you say?&#8221;</p>
<p>Tom&#8217;s face relaxed into a smirking smile as he
also took a long survey of Angela.</p>
<p>&#8220;Canoe&#8217;s purty full up, but I dare say we can
find room. Where&#8217;d ye want to go?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Anywhere out of this. Some place from
where I can cable to England&mdash;for money.&#8221;</p>
<p>He looked at &#8220;Connie,&#8221; the sallow man, and
nodded. The latter turned to Angela.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re off in the morning. Is that your
grip?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Better leave it in the shack. There&#8217;s a small
room at the back you kin hev&#8217; to sleep in to-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>She thanked him and went inside the shack.
Big bundles lay on the floor ready for the
journey, and from the window in the back room
she saw a long, newly made canoe. She put
down her sack, and decided to get some food in
the town with the few dollars she possessed, before
taking refuge in the shack from Jim, who
would doubtless return by the evening.</p>
<hr class='minor' />

<p>When she returned the third man was present.
She smiled at the three of them as pleasantly as
she knew how, and repaired to the back room.
She imagined Jim&#8217;s amazement and wrath when
he discovered she had gone. But it was extremely
doubtful if he would find her in the short
time that remained before her departure.</p>
<p>Time passed slowly enough. From outside
came the sound of low voices. She crept to the
keyhole and saw her three future companions
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
sitting round the rough table engrossed in a game
of cards&mdash;poker. Close to hand were two bottles
and three mugs. Now and again a low curse
came to her ears. She began to wish the door
possessed a lock and key!</p>
<p>She went back to the mattress and endeavored
to get to sleep, but her brain was too full of the
impending adventure to permit its flight into unconsciousness.
Moreover, the card party began
to get boisterous. She wondered if they were
going to keep it up all night. A few minutes
later there was a loud crash. She sat up and
heard fierce arguments proceeding from the
inner room. All three of them were talking at
once, and she could not hear any intelligent sentence,
but it was all to do with the &#8220;deal.&#8221; She
went again to the keyhole just as they settled
down again to play.</p>
<p>To her amazement they were playing with
matches. The big chimpanzee man, Tom, had a
huge pile in front of him. In the center of the
table was another pile. She saw Tom put down
his cards and growl &#8220;Three Queens,&#8221; picking up
the matches in the pool with a triumphant laugh.</p>
<p>&#8220;Last deal,&#8221; said Connie.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yep. It&#8217;s between me and you, Connie, <i>but
I guess she&#8217;s mine</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Chickens ain&#8217;t hatched yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She ain&#8217;t no chicken&mdash;she&#8217;s peaches. Gee&mdash;some
stake that!&#8221;</p>
<p>Angela suddenly felt sick as the truth came to
her. She saw now the meaning of those matches.
They were not playing for money, <i>but for her</i>!
She sprang to the window, but escape that way
was impossible, for it was not more than a foot
square. Her heart beat in terrible suspense. She
realized her dreadful position&mdash;out here, a mile
or more from the town, she was utterly at the
mercy of these brutes. They considered her fair
prey, as most women were considered in the
Klondyke at that time. Pleading a husband
would make no difference. A woman ought to
know better than to leave her husband. Unwittingly
she had placed herself in that position.</p>
<p>There was only one way out, and that way lay
through the inner room. She resolved to take it.
She took the small sack and approached the door.
A look through the keyhole revealed them engrossed
in the decisive &#8220;hand.&#8221; With heaving
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
bosom she turned the handle and walked swiftly
through the door.</p>
<p>She was almost past the table before they
recovered from their surprise. Then the chimpanzee
man put out a huge arm and caught her
by the wrist.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Ere, what&#8217;s this?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me go.&#8221;</p>
<p>He grinned maliciously.</p>
<p>&#8220;I <i>should</i> say. Why, I&#8217;ve jest won you!&#8221;</p>
<p>She struggled in vain in his iron grip.</p>
<p>&#8220;Git back to thet room!&#8221; he ordered, and flung
her towards the door.</p>
<p>It was the first time any man had laid hands
on her, and it aroused the devil. Her face and
neck went crimson. Some of the fear vanished
under this storm of violent repugnance. She
noticed a naked hunting-knife on a ledge by the
window. She flew to it and gripped it menacingly.</p>
<p>She came nearer and raised it to strike any
obstructors. Then Connie&#8217;s lean figure leapt forward.
The knife rattled to the floor and her
wrist ached from the blow he had dealt it. He
took her by the shoulders.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Cut that! Tom&#8217;s won you, and you&#8217;d better
get wise to that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You brutes! Do you think you can&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Her voice petered out as she saw the horrible
expression in Tom&#8217;s eyes. There was no hope of
mercy there. Words were lost on this monster.
All the evening he had dwelled with rapture
upon the object of the gamble. He took her from
Connie and held her fast in his arms. Connie
laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;You allus had the luck. Wal, perhaps she&#8217;ll
transfer her affections later!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me go!&#8221; she cried, now thoroughly panic-stricken.
&#8220;Oh, God!&mdash;let me go!&#8221;</p>
<p>The chimpanzee-man merely gurgled in his
throat. He lifted her from the ground and made
for the inner room. One of her hands became
free. She seized a bunch of his hair until it was
wrenched from his hard scalp.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ugh!&#8221; he grunted. &#8220;Go on&mdash;it&#8217;s my turn in
a minnit.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You monster!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-night&mdash;boys!&#8221; he cried mockingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Happy dreams!&#8221; sneered Connie. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
forget we start&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span></p>
<p>The third man, a silent, morose individual,
suddenly gave a gasp as the outer door was
flung open. The others turned and saw the enraged
face of Colorado Jim behind a big six-shooter.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<h3>ANGELA MEETS A FRIEND</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Hands up!&#8221; snapped Jim.</p>
<p>Connie and the silent man obeyed.
Tom, clasping his prize, looked
thunderstruck.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you git that, you human gorilla? Put
&#8217;em up.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tom let Angela slip to the floor.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s all this?&#8221; he growled.</p>
<p>Jim gripped the deal table with one huge hand
and flung it across the room. He advanced on
Connie and slapped the latter&#8217;s pockets.</p>
<p>&#8220;No guns? Good!&#8221;</p>
<p>Connie went flying from a violent shove, likewise
the silent man.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come here&mdash;you!&#8221; bawled Jim.</p>
<p>Tom came forward, his ugly face curved in a
look of intense hate. He felt Jim snatch the revolver
from his belt and pocket it.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s your lay?&#8221; he growled.</p>
<p>Jim put his own revolver away and Tom&#8217;s
hands dropped to his side.</p>
<p>&#8220;So you took a fancy to my property, eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>Tom recoiled before the blazing eyes of his
adversary. He was big and hefty enough, but no
match for the well-proportioned, muscular giant
before him. He was good at assessing physical
values, and he felt scared.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s mine,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I won her.&#8221;</p>
<p>Angela, crouching at the end of the room, saw
the storm brewing. She suddenly remembered
the knife, and retrieved it lest one of the trio
should lay hands on it. She saw Connie and his
silent friend edging behind Jim, and one quick
glance from Tom&#8217;s vile face told her that the
three were filled with a common purpose. Connie
suddenly snatched up a log of wood.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jim!&#8221; she cried, as the three men suddenly
sprang forward.</p>
<p>The big figure moved like a streak of lightning.
Tom was caught by two powerful arms and
lifted clean off his feet. He hung for one brief
second, six inches from the ground, and then executed
an arc in thin air to come down with a crash
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
against the match-boarded wall. The other two
were close upon him. He dealt with the log-swinging
man first. Connie&#8217;s arm was already
raised and the thick piece of wood was on the
point of coming down. Had it descended, the
Honorable Angela might have been a widow
there and then, but a fifty-inch leg prevented
that untimely catastrophe. It came out from
Jim&#8217;s thigh, true in the horizontal plane, and
smote Connie in the tenderest part of his anatomy.
He made no sound whatever, but dropped
in a crumpled heap and lay still. The silent
man was caught in mid-air. He had never expected
the amazingly quick movement of the
arms that held him. He was a miserable specimen,
physically, and turned green when he saw
the big fist drawn back to strike.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, you ain&#8217;t big enough to hit,&#8221; said Jim.
&#8220;You seem to like me; come closer honey, come
close!&#8221;</p>
<p>He gathered the man close in and, exerting all
his strength, crushed every atom of breath from
the man&#8217;s body. Angela, sick with the sight of
this animal manifestation, protested.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll kill him! He never did me any harm.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span></p>
<p>Jim dropped his victim with a grunt. A queer
reaction set in. He was sorry. He could have
rescued her without this horse-play, but the sight
of her in the arms of a human chimpanzee, who
knew no morality but that of the cave-man, had
aroused all the innate fury within him. After
all, he loved her! Even though she despised him,
and preferred the company of licentious beachcombers,
he worshiped her. The very thought
seemed to mock at him from within.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do I have to yank you back, or will you come
freely?&#8221; he said in a low voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll come,&#8221; she replied.</p>
<p>They walked back to the tent in silence. She
noticed that the note had gone from the flap.
How he had tracked her down was a mystery.
He refrained from mentioning the adventure,
but she saw that it had had a great effect upon
him. He ate no supper, but sat smoking through
the mosquito-netting, gazing pensively at the
starry heavens. When they retired he uttered
his customary &#8220;Good-night, Angela.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-night,&#8221; she replied.</p>
<p>The next morning found him busy caulking a
big flat-bottomed boat, which was already half
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
laden with stores. She looked at him inquiringly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Going down the river,&#8221; he informed her.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve staked two claims along a creek called &#8216;Red
Ruin.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it far?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Matter of five miles.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A-ah!&#8221;</p>
<p>The remaining gear was placed in the boat.
Angela took a seat in the bows whilst Jim threw
his weight on the pole, the sole means of propulsion.
There was a loud crack, and the punter
was almost thrown over the side as the rotten
pole broke in the middle. The strong current
sent the craft whirling down-stream. Jim
grabbed a coil of rope, made it fast to a ring-bolt,
and went over the side. He reached the bank and
pulled the craft inshore.</p>
<p>&#8220;Throw out the ax. I&#8217;ll go cut a new pole.&#8221;</p>
<p>She handed him the weapon, keen as a razor,
and watched him tramp up the steep bank. A
slight breeze shifted the mist from the sprawling,
muddy river and the sun clove through. An
isolated mass of ice swirled along, melting as it
went. A small island in the center of the stream
was gashed and scoured by the recent ice-flow.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span>
Trees along the bank had been shorn clear by the
enormous pressure of the bergs as they fought
their way to freedom. She was sitting thinking
of the inscrutable future when a canoe hove into
sight. The occupants&mdash;two Indians and a white
man&mdash;were driving it up-stream at amazing
speed, considering the fact that the down current
was running at a speed of at least five knots.
They were passing her, scarcely a dozen yards
distant, when she gave a cry of astonishment.</p>
<p>&#8220;D&#8217;Arcy!&#8221;</p>
<p>The white man ceased paddling and looked up
sharply. He turned to the Indians and rapped
out an order. The canoe drifted in towards
Angela&#8217;s craft and D&#8217;Arcy held out his hand,
with absolute wonder written in his eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Angela Featherstone, by all that&#8217;s holy!
What are you doing here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m with my husband,&#8221; she replied bitterly.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I thought&mdash;I read that you were giving
house parties, attending race-meetings, and all
that sort of thing. I came to Canada the week
before you were married. I read about it and
wondered who the happy man was.&#8221;</p>
<p>Angela&#8217;s hand played with the running water.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span>
D&#8217;Arcy was scarcely more than an acquaintance,
but at least he was one of her own set. Like a
lot of other men, D&#8217;Arcy had made love to her
and been repulsed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look here, I don&#8217;t understand this,&#8221; rejoined
D&#8217;Arcy. &#8220;You&mdash;you aren&#8217;t prospecting?&#8221;</p>
<p>She nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Great Scott! It&#8217;s bad enough for men, but
for a woman&mdash;&mdash;!&#8221; He looked round. &#8220;Is your
husband about?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s up the bank cutting a new pole.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see.&#8221;</p>
<p>He gave her another searching look, the meaning
of which was clear to her. In the same mute
but eloquent language she gave him to understand
the chief fact&mdash;she was unhappy.</p>
<p>&#8220;To bring you here&mdash;to bring a cultured
woman into a country like this&mdash;&mdash;!&#8221;</p>
<p>Words failed him. He touched her hand
softly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where are you making for?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A creek down the river called &#8217;Red Ruin.&#8217;
He has staked two claims there.&#8221;</p>
<p>He nodded reflectively.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m making for Dawson for some gear. I&#8217;ll
drop in and see you some day if I may?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do. I should enjoy a talk with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your&mdash;your husband won&#8217;t object?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Does it matter?&#8221;</p>
<p>He laughed and, shaking her hand, paddled
his frail craft out into the stream. Looking up,
she saw Jim coming down the bank, with the ax
swinging in one hand and a new pole over his
shoulder. He unfastened the rope and entered
the boat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who was that?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;An old friend,&#8221; she replied coldly.</p>
<p>She saw his eyes flash as he threw his weight
on the pole and sent the boat hurtling down the
river. But for the bitterness rankling within her,
she might have found time to admire her pilot.
Big as he was, there was nothing ungainly about
him. Every movement was beautiful in its
perfect exhibition of muscular energy. The hard
knotted muscles in his bare arms swelled and
relaxed as they performed the work allotted
them. Little beads of perspiration sparkled on
the bare neck, and the wind played among the
streaming mass of his black hair. But she had no
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span>
eyes for this. From the moment when he had
unceremoniously forced her on this journey of
horror and desolation her wounded pride had
smothered every other emotion. Her soul hungered
for one thing&mdash;escape. Thwarted though
her other attempts had been, she meant to try
again. To try, and try, until he grew sick of
holding a woman against her will. The unexpected
genesis of D&#8217;Arcy raised her hopes to high
pitch.</p>
<p>They ultimately entered the narrow, sluggish
creek, and Jim beached the boat on the northern
side. She saw several stakes driven in the earth,
and realized that these marked the boundaries of
the two claims.</p>
<p>They pitched the tent some distance from the
claims&mdash;high up on the bank, to guard against
the trickling water that ran down the bluff and
into the creek.</p>
<p>On the morrow Jim started digging. She condescended
to take a little interest in this, for the
experience was novel. A lucky strike might
mean freedom from this life of hardship and
misery. Once back in England&mdash;&mdash; The thought
was tantalizing. She watched Jim commence to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span>
drive a hole through the matted undergrowth,
exhibiting surprise when the pick rang hard on
the frozen earth beneath.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rock?&#8221; she queried.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nope&mdash;earth. It&#8217;s froze right down for a
hundred feet. Bed-rock ought to be three or four
feet down. That&#8217;s where the gold is&mdash;or ought
to be.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And if it isn&#8217;t there?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sink another hole, an&#8217; keep on doin&#8217; it till I
git it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Later in the day he reached bed-rock, at a
depth of six feet from the surface. The washing-pan
came into operation, and he sought eagerly
for the golden dust&mdash;in vain.</p>
<p>&#8220;Muck!&#8221; he ejaculated.</p>
<p>The next pan, and the next, produced similar
results. He commenced another hole about six
feet from the first, driving through fallen trees
and vegetable matter that had lain there for tens
of centuries. When the evening came no sign of
gold had appeared. He went to the tent and
partook of the meal that Angela had prepared.</p>
<p>&#8220;Any luck?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nope, but it&#8217;ll come. If not here, then somewhere
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span>
else. But there&#8217;s five hundred feet of
frontage to be bored yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>Angela shrugged her shoulders. He talked as
though time was of no importance. She knew he
would go on and on until he had achieved what
he set out to do. The summer was short&mdash;a brief
four months. In October down would come the
winter, freezing everything solid for eight long
months. Between October 21 and November 8
the Yukon would close until the middle of May.
She realized that she had, as yet, tasted but the
latter end of winter. To live through the whole
length of the Arctic night, away in the vast
wilderness of the North, was a prospect that
appalled her.</p>
<p>She wandered up the bank, and through the
dense growth of hemlock that led to a precipitous
hill. High up on its slope she stopped and surveyed
the landscape. Despite the bitterness of
her soul, she could not repress an exclamation of
wonderment.</p>
<p>Stretching away in all directions was tier
upon tier of snow-clad peaks, aglow with the soft
radiance of the low-lying sun as it swept the
horizon towards the North in its uninterrupted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span>
circuit of the heavens. The southern end of the
Alaskan range seemed like an opalescent serrated
bow, changing to violet through all the darker
hues of the spectrum by some strange freak of
the atmosphere, only to leap into glorious amber
as the fringe of a cloud passed across the origin
of illumination.</p>
<p>Everything seemed so vast, so forbidding, it
reduced her to a state of ignominy. If one desired
a sense of Eternity, here it was. Time and
space merged into one inscrutable entity&mdash;the
Spirit of the North. She had felt that Spirit
when crossing the passes that led to the Klondyke.
Here it was limned in clearer form. The
everlasting peaks; the aquamarine glaciers,
roaring and plunging into the sea; the vast
forests sprawling across the valleys and up the
bases of the mountains to some two thousand
feet, virgin as they were ten thousand years ago;
the noisy fiords cumbered with the ice of crystal
rivers, breaking the deathlike silence with ear-splitting
concussions&mdash;all combined in one awe-inspiring
picture of nature&#8217;s incomparable handiwork.</p>
<p>And here under her feet were fragrant flowers,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
lured from the shallow covering of earth and
matted creeper to last but a brief season, and
then to sleep the whole long winter under the
snow.</p>
<p>She sighed and made her way down the hill
towards the tent. Beside the fire was Jim,
gazing into the past. She thought her husband
was like this strange immense land&mdash;cruel but
magnificent, primal and alluring, yet hateful.
As she approached, a similar comparison entered
Jim&#8217;s mind, with her as the object.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cold and proud as a mountain peak,&#8221; he
muttered. &#8220;There&#8217;s no sun that can melt her,
no storm that can move her. God, but she&#8217;s
beautiful!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h3>FRUITLESS TOIL</h3>
</div>

<p>The two claims on Red Ruin became as
honeycombed as a wasp&#8217;s nest. Day
after day Angela watched the bare-armed,
red-shirted figure at work, witnessing his
failure with a set face. It became patent that
the claims were bad ones, and that Red Ruin was
living up to its name. All the labor of driving
through matted undergrowth and frozen gravel
was vain. &#8220;Hope long deferred maketh the
heart sick,&#8221; and it made Angela&#8217;s sick. She
knew that sooner or later Jim must accept the
inevitable and abandon the quest&mdash;there. She
hoped it would be soon. After all, failure meant
the same as success&mdash;to her.</p>
<p>If Red Ruin failed, what else could he do but
pack up and go home, as thousands of others
were doing? The patched-up steamers that were
now plying up the river were packed with a queer
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span>
gathering of &#8220;failures&#8221; and &#8220;successes.&#8221; Men
who had staked all on this promising gamble
were going back to the harness of civilization,
sadder and wiser beings. The relatively few
successful ones were making programmes for the
future&mdash;a future in which an unaccustomed
luxury figured prominently. Disease and
famine were taking their toll of the participants
in the great adventure. From all along the
Yukon watershed came news of pestilence and
panic. Scurvy raged in Circle City, and a hungry
mob at Forty Mile was only quelled by
troopers with loaded rifles. A boat coming up-river
laden with 200 belated gold-mad men and
women was stopped by the Commissioner, and
all but those who had foresight enough to bring a
twelve-months&#8217; food supply were refused a landing,
for the famine was acute.</p>
<p>These pitiful facts came to Angela&#8217;s ears.
Even money could no longer purchase food. The
knowledge put a terrible weapon into her hands.
If she destroyed their food supply freedom was
assured. For one hour she even contemplated
this means of escape. Was it not for his good
too? Could he hope to win where thousands had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span>
failed? She tried to convince herself that it
would be no act of treachery but one of kindness.
The lie rankled in her brain. A revulsion of
feeling came as she reflected upon the immediate
past, for despite all her antagonism she could not
but admire the indomitable will of him. Failure
was written all over the two honeycombed claims,
but it never daunted him. She heard the spade
and ax ringing on the hard earth from early
morning till late evening, and saw him swinging
up the hill, a little grim, but otherwise unchanged.</p>
<p>She was impatiently waiting for him to confess
his failure, but he never did. There was still
some hundred feet of river front to be &#8220;tried
out,&#8221; and Jim calmly went on boring his monotonous
holes. It was maddening to watch him.</p>
<p>One morning two men came poling down the
creek in a flat-bottomed boat packed with gear
and food. They pulled up at sight of Jim. He
recognized them as the owners of two claims
farther up the creek.</p>
<p>&#8220;Still diggin&#8217;, pard?&#8221; queried one.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yep.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wal, it&#8217;s sure a waste of time. There ain&#8217;t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span>
no pay dirt on this yere creek. We got five
hundred feet up yonder plum full of holes, and
we ain&#8217;t shoveled out naught but muck.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim stretched himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tain&#8217;t panning out up to schedule,&#8221; he
grunted, &#8220;but I&#8217;m going through with this bit
afore I hit the trail again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Better cut it, Cap,&#8221; said the second man. &#8220;I
gotta hunch they didn&#8217;t call this Red Ruin for
nothin&#8217;. See here, I found six abandoned claims
half a mile up. I reckon the guys who pitched
that lot over were the same as did the christening
of this bit of water.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim laughed carelessly. He had little doubt
that the location was bad, but it went against his
nature to quit before he had carried out his task.
The first man stuck a wad of tobacco between his
back teeth.</p>
<p>&#8220;That pardner o&#8217; yourn don&#8217;t seem to take
kindly to diggin&#8217;,&#8221; he ejaculated.</p>
<p>Jim stared at him, and then tightened his lips.</p>
<p>&#8220;No need to fly off the handle, Cap. I had a
pard like him once, strong on paper but liked the
other fellow to do the diggin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What the blazes are you talkin&#8217; about?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span>
demanded Jim. &#8220;I ain&#8217;t inviting you to give
opinions. What&#8217;s more, she ain&#8217;t a <i>him</i>. You
go to hell&mdash;and quick about it!&#8221;</p>
<p>The man looked at his comrade and they both
grinned. Jim put down the spade in a way that
caused them to stare blankly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wal, you&#8217;re some joker. Pete, am I blind?
It&#8217;s no odds, anyway, and no offense meant, but
by ginger! it&#8217;s the first time I&#8217;ve seen a woman
smoke a two-dollar cigar.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim suddenly felt dazed as a new explanation
entered his mind. He stepped down towards the
boat.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s all this?&#8221; he inquired. &#8220;I&#8217;m kinder
interested.&#8221;</p>
<p>The first man explained.</p>
<p>&#8220;I bin campin&#8217; way back there. The other
guys who abandoned them claims played hell
with the timber&mdash;gormandized the whole lot&mdash;must
have gone in for the timber business. So
I bin cuttin&#8217; spruce up there on the hill. Wal, I
often seen you drilling holes in this muck, but
damn me if I ever seen your pard put a hand to
the spade. He seems to live in that darned tent.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span>
I seen him twice hiking out&mdash;to Dawson, for a
jag, I guess. Didn&#8217;t seem on the level to
me&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim&#8217;s mouth twitched. He had no doubt
about the veracity of this statement. Someone
had been visiting Angela, and she had said nothing
of it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t know he went to Dawson,&#8221; he replied
evasively. &#8220;Thanks for the information. I&#8217;ll
sure talk to him about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>They nodded and began to pole down the creek
and out into the river. Jim sat down on a pile
of muck and mopped his brow. The tent was
approachable from the river on the other side of
the bluff. The spruce-trees that surrounded it
hid it from the view of one working by the creek,
though any occupant would have the advantage
of seeing without being seen. He remembered
reaching the tent a few days before, to find
Angela singularly embarrassed. Was that the
day on which the stranger had called? Despite
his heartache he could think no wrong of her.
She was lonely, pining for the life she had left.
Between him and her loomed an apparently unbridgeable
gulf. If she had found a friend in that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span>
mixed crowd back in Dawson, hadn&#8217;t she a right
to see him and speak with him? His heart
answered in the affirmative, but it hurt just the
same.</p>
<p>He said nothing to Angela on the subject, but
carried on with his thankless task, with a strange
mixture of pride and jealousy eating into his
heart. When more wood was needed he innocently(?)
hewed down two spruce-trees in close
proximity to the tent, whose removal afforded
him a view of the tent entrance from the scene
of his daily &#8220;grind.&#8221;</p>
<p>For a whole week he kept his eyes intermittently
on the brown bell-tent, but the stranger
came not. He wondered if Angela had become
aware of the increased vision afforded him by the
felled trees, and was careful to keep her strange
friend away. He noticed some slight change in
her disposition&mdash;a queer light in her eye and a
mocking ring in the monosyllabic replies which
she gave to any questions he found it necessary
to put to her.</p>
<p>Their conversation had not improved with
time. If he addressed her at all it was with reference
to the domestic arrangements. She, on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span>
her part, never interrogated him on any subject.
Every movement of her lips, and of her body,
made it clear that she regarded him as a complete
stranger under whose jailership certain circumstances
had placed her. Her determination was
scarcely less than his own. She meant to break
his stubborn spirit&mdash;to arouse in him, if possible,
a violent aversion to her presence. Already
the summer was vanishing. The few birds&mdash;swallows,
swifts, and yellow warblers&mdash;that had
immigrated at the coming of spring were preparing
for a long journey South. Cold winds
were turning the leaves brown, and the whole
landscape deepened into autumn glory. Angela
noted the change with an impatience that was
evident to any observer.</p>
<p>Jim, testing the last few yards of claim, pondered
over the problem of her change of front.
She even sang at times, in a way that only
succeeded in deepening his suspicions. Was she
singing on account of some happiness newly
found?&mdash;some interest in life which lay beyond
himself and the immediate surroundings?</p>
<p>It seemed to be the case, and the consciousness
of this disturbing truth caused him acute mental
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span>
agony. Some other man could bring her happiness.
Some other man had succeeded in breaking
into that icy reserve against which all attempts
on his part had been vain. Was it worth
while continuing the drama? If he let her escape,
forgetfulness might come. Time had its reward
no less than its revenges. Why suffer, as he was
suffering, all the agonies of burning, unrequited
love. At nights, with that hateful curtain
between them, he had writhed in anguish to hear
the soft breathing within a foot or so of his head.
More than once a mad desire to rise up and claim
her as mate came to him, only to be cast aside
as the better part of him prevailed over these
primal instincts.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s mine,&#8221; he argued, &#8220;mine by purchase,
an&#8217; if I was anything of a man I&#8217;d go and take
her now.&#8221;</p>
<p>But just because he was a man he didn&#8217;t. She
owed her sanctity to the fact that this rough son
of Nature loved her with a love that seemed to
rend his heart in twain. The thin canvas
between them was as safe a partition as walls
of granite. She might have found time to admire
the quality of his love, considering the circumstances
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span>
prevailing, but her pride left scant room
for any sentiment of that sort. She merely took
these things for granted.</p>
<p>Jim, with the last hole bored in the iron earth,
and the precious glint of gold still as absent as
ever, gazed back at the tent with knitted brows.
Red Ruin was a failure, as he had long known it
to be. The future loomed dark and uncertain.
There were no more creeks near Dawson worth
the staking, but gold lay farther afield&mdash;over the
vast repelling mountains. It would mean suffering,
misery, for her. A winter in the Great
Alone, harassed by blizzards, bitten by the intense
cold, tracked by wolves and all the ferocious
starved things of the foodless wilderness,
was all he had to offer&mdash;that, and a burning love
of which she seemed totally unconscious, or
coldly indifferent. Why not let her go now?
To see her suffer were but to multiply his own
suffering a thousandfold, and yet she was his in
the sight of God! He emitted a hard, guttural
laugh as the mockery of the phrase was made
clear to him.</p>
<p>He collected the gear and, slinging it across
his shoulders, mounted the hill. Overhead a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span>
long stream of birds was beating toward the
South. He bade them a mute farewell, knowing
that he would miss their silvern voices, and their
morning wrangling among the spruce and hemlocks.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess life might be beautiful enough,&#8221; he
ruminated, &#8220;if one only had the things one
wants, but the gittin&#8217; of &#8217;em is sure hell!&#8221;</p>
<p>He flung the pick and ax and washing-pan to
the ground, and looked inside the tent. It was
empty, and the cooking utensils were lying about
as they were left at breakfast-time. Then he
noticed that some of Angela&#8217;s clothes were missing.
The latter fact removed any lingering
doubts from his mind. If any further evidence
were required, it existed in the shape of a pile of
cigar ash on the duckboarding.</p>
<p>&#8220;So!&#8221; he muttered.</p>
<p>He walked outside and stood gazing over the
autumn-tinted country. A stray bird twitted
among the trees, but the great silence was settling
down every hour as the feathered immigrants
mounted from copse and dell into the blue
vault of heaven.</p>
<p>&#8220;So!&#8221; he repeated, as though he were powerless
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
to find any fuller expression of his emotions.
He went back into the tent and slipped a revolver
into his holster, then with huge strides went over
the hill towards Dawson.</p>
<p>He covered the five miles in less than fifty
minutes, and entered the congested main street.
The saloons were busy as usual, and there seemed
to be more people than ever. A trading store
was selling mackinaws, parkhas, and snow-shoes,
as fast as they could be handled. &#8220;Old-timers&#8221;
lounged in the doorway and grinned at the huge
prices paid for these winter necessaries. Jim
evaded the throng and made for the river bank.
He guessed that Angela and her &#8220;friend&#8221; would
not risk staying long in Dawson, and had doubtless
timed their escape to catch the last boat
down-river.</p>
<p>At that moment the <i>Silas P. Young</i> gave
announcement of its departure by two long
blasts from its steam-whistle. Jim came out on
the river bank and saw the boat well out in the
stream, its paddle churning up the muddy water.
Near him was an old man waving a red handkerchief.
He recognized Jim and stopped his signaling.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span></p>
<p>&#8220;So you&#8217;ve sent her home, pard? Wal, it&#8217;s a
darn good&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yore wife. I sent mine too. It&#8217;s going to be
merry hell in this yere town afore the summer
comes round&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim stood petrified. He had half expected
this, but now that he was face to face with it the
blow came harder than he expected it to be. She
was going&mdash;going out of his life for ever....
Perhaps it was as well that way. He turned to
Hanky, the old man.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you see her go?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yep. I saw her go aboard.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Was&mdash;was there any other guy with her?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No&mdash;leastways, that fellow D&#8217;Arcy saw her
off. Friend of yours, I take it?&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim nodded, scarcely trusting himself to speak.
The name was unknown to him, but he remembered
the man in the canoe who had spoken to
Angela a few months before. It must be the
same man&mdash;the man who had visited her at the
camp, and who had dropped the cigar ash on the
floor that morning. D&#8217;Arcy had triumphed,
then! He concluded that the latter must be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span>
aboard, though Hanky had not seen him go on
the boat. He thought of Lord Featherstone and
all those fine relations and friends of Angela&#8217;s.
How they would chuckle when they heard that
she had escaped from her &#8220;impossible husband&#8221;!
His gorge rose as he visualized the scene. They
had sold him something only to get it back again
for nothing. It wasn&#8217;t straight dealing&mdash;it
wasn&#8217;t on the level. They had bargained on this
eventuality when they made the deal. They concluded
it would be easy to hoodwink a &#8220;cowpuncher.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, by God!&#8221; he muttered. &#8220;I ain&#8217;t lettin&#8217;
go.&#8221;</p>
<p>He turned to Hanky.</p>
<p>&#8220;You gotta hoss, Hank?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you loan him to me for an hour or two?
I&#8217;ll take care of him. I&#8217;m strong on hosses.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s yourn,&#8221; replied Hanky. &#8220;Come right
along and I&#8217;ll fix you up. She&#8217;s stabled at Dan&#8217;s
place.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ten minutes later Jim was mounted on the big
black mare. He waved his hand to Hanky and
went up the street like a streak of lightning.</p>
<hr class='major' />

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<h3>INTO THE WILDERNESS</h3>
</div>

<p>Hanky&#8217;s mare, after being cooped up in
a stable for a week without exercise,
stretched its neck to the fresh air, and
under the urging heels of Jim killed space at a
remarkable rate. Mounting an almost perpendicular
hill, Jim saw the <i>Silas P. Young</i> beating
down-stream, a mile or two ahead, at a steady ten
knots.</p>
<p>He made queer noises with his lips and his
mount responded instantly, leaping with distended
nostrils over stone and hummocks, like
a piece of live steel. To be on a horse again was
glorious. Instantly his form had merged with
the animal&#8217;s&mdash;they moved as one creature, raising
dust and moss as they thundered down the
river.</p>
<p>The boat turned a corner and was lost to view
for a few minutes, but a mile lower down he saw
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span>
it again, with a creamy wake streaming behind
it. He was nearer now and going strong. He
pressed his hand over the glossy neck of the horse
and crooned to it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gee, yore some hoss&mdash;you beaut! The man
that lays whip on your flanks oughter be shot.
We&#8217;re gaining, honey. Another league and we&#8217;ll
be putting it over that &#8217;honking&#8217; bunch of
machinery. Stead-dee!&#8221;</p>
<p>The thundering pace was maintained. Uphill,
downhill, on the flat, it was all the same. Heels
were no longer necessary. The horse understood
that the big &#8220;horse-man&#8221; wanted to get somewhere
in quick time, and meant to see him
through.</p>
<p>Twenty minutes later they were abreast of the
<i>Silas P. Young</i>. Then they shot into a deep
gully and were lost among a thick forest of
spruce-trees. For two miles horse and man
evaded low-hanging branches and treacherous
footfalls, until the timber thinned and the straggling
Yukon came again to view. Away up-stream
was the steamboat, crawling down by the
near bank. There was no time to be lost if
Angela&#8217;s escape was to be frustrated. He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span>
tethered his foam-flecked mount to a tree and
crept down the steep bank. The muddied water
swirled along at a ramping five knots&mdash;a vile-looking
cocoa-colored mass that was scarcely inviting
to any swimmer. He raised his hands and
dived down.</p>
<p>With a powerful over-arm stroke he made for
the line which the steamboat was following. In
that wide welter of water the bobbing head
would in all probability be lost to view, or any
kind of shout would be drowned by the clanking
noise of the paddle-wheels. The extreme danger
of the exploit was not lost upon him, but the resolve,
once rooted, stuck fast.</p>
<p>He looked up and saw the <i>Silas P. Young</i>
bearing down on him, her squat nose setting her
course in dead line with his eyes. Treading
water, he waited for the psychological moment.
The chief danger lay in the vicinity of the paddle-wheel.
To be caught up in that meant certain
death. He resolved to fetch the boat as near
the bows as possible and on the port side.</p>
<p>He heard a bell ring twice, and then to his
horror the boat changed her course. It was
barely two hundred yards away, and bore
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
straight down on him. He dived and swam for
his life to avoid direct impact.... At that
moment a man saw him and yelled out something
to the Captain. The latter peered over the side,
but saw nothing.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re drunk!&#8221; he retorted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell you I seen a man right under her nose.
Better stop the boat.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Captain shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess I&#8217;ll keep straight on,&#8221; he replied.
&#8220;What&#8217;s it got to do with me, anyway?
He ain&#8217;t a passenger&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He stopped and gasped as an enormous, saturated
spectre climbed over the side. A crowd of
men playing cards nearby stopped their game
and stared.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who in hell are you?&#8221; asked the Captain.</p>
<p>Jim shook the wet from his hair and pushed
forward without a word. His keen eyes ranged
all over the packed decks. Then he grunted as
he caught sight of a familiar figure in the stern
of the boat. It was Angela, white of face, and
amazed at the appearance of this totally unexpected
apparition. The crowd, struck dumb with
wonderment, made way for him. He strode up
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span>
to Angela and stopped within a foot of her, gazing
fixedly into her eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;You!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yep&mdash;it&#8217;s me all right. Are you ready?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ready&mdash;&mdash;!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t wait too long. It&#8217;s a tidy swim, and
the river gits wider every mile.&#8221;</p>
<p>She recoiled from him in horror. For the past
hour she had been dreaming of the comforts and
joys of civilization. Once in the river, escape
had seemed certain&mdash;and here was her pugnacious
jailer with determination written all over
his set features.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m waiting,&#8221; he said calmly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you mad?&#8221; she retorted. &#8220;I&#8217;m finished
with that terrible life. This time you have come
too late. Unless you go ashore now there will
not be another chance.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then we&#8217;ll go right now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yep&mdash;you and me.&#8221;</p>
<p>He moved towards her and caught her firmly
by the arm. A group of men, interested spectators
of the drama, thought it was time to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span>
interfere. One of them, a grizzled man of fifty,
touched Jim on the arm.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s all this, stranger?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t butt in,&#8221; growled Jim.</p>
<p>His interrogator disregarded him, and turned
to Angela.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is this broiler, missie?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He is&mdash;he is&mdash;&mdash;. He wants to take me back
there, to a place I hate! Oh, please bring the
Captain!&#8221;</p>
<p>The captain was already pushing his way
through the crowd, annoyed at this unconventional
method of boarding his ship. He put both
hands in his pockets, stuck out his little bearded
chin, and glared at Jim.</p>
<p>&#8220;What the blazes do you mean by boarding my
ship? Where&#8217;s your ticket, eh? And leave that
lady alone&mdash;she&#8217;s a passenger of mine.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some of his indignation vanished when the
fierce gray eyes of Jim fixed him in an unflinching
stare. He saw trouble looming in the offing.
Jim turned his eyes to Angela.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll be mushing,&#8221; he said briefly.</p>
<p>Linking her arm in his, he began to push
through the crowd. The grizzled man said something
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span>
to his comrade, and they spread out
and formed a human barrier to his further
progress.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t butt in, boys&mdash;&#8217;tain&#8217;t healthy,&#8221; warned
Jim.</p>
<p>&#8220;Git him!&#8221; whispered the grizzled man, &#8220;and
yank him back in the river!&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim&#8217;s hand flew to his belt and the big
revolver was jerked out in a trice. He pushed
it into the stomach of the foremost man, and
caused that worthy to shiver with terror. The
latter backed away, whilst his friends hunted for
firearms.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stand aside!&#8221; roared Jim.</p>
<p>The lane widened, but at the end of it were
two men handling revolvers, with a dangerous
glint in their eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;So yore after stoppin&#8217; a man eloping with
his own wife, eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wife&mdash;&mdash;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thet&#8217;s so.&#8221;</p>
<p>The crowd stared. This put a new complexion
on matters. The Captain looked at Angela.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, is that husky your &#8217;old man&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p>Angela flushed with embarrassment.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I hate him, and I won&#8217;t go with him!&#8221; she
cried hotly.</p>
<p>The Captain spread out his hands.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why in hell didn&#8217;t you say so afore?&#8221; he
asked Jim.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it any of your darned business?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess it&#8217;s your funeral, all right,&#8221; chuckled
the grizzled man.</p>
<p>&#8220;Better come on as far as Eagle. I&#8217;ll put you
off there,&#8221; said the Captain. &#8220;Can&#8217;t stop just
here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim shook his head and moved towards the rail.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure in a hurry,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We ain&#8217;t
scared of a drop of water, are we Angy?&#8221;</p>
<p>Angela bestowed upon him a look of mingled
contempt and terror. The high wooded bank
seemed miles away, and the river ran like a millrace.</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t come&mdash;I won&#8217;t!&#8221; she hissed.</p>
<p>But he had already reached the rail. Her
heart seemed to freeze with horror as he lifted
her on to the seat and clasped her firmly round
the waist, imprisoning her arms so that resistance
became impossible.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Stop!&#8221; yelled the Captain. &#8220;You can&#8217;t go
that way&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>A gasp came from the crowd as they saw him
take a deep breath and leap down with his burden.
They disappeared beneath the filthy water,
to come to the surface a few seconds later in
exactly the same position as they had entered it&mdash;Angela
with her arms held from behind, and the
amazing husband swimming on his broad back,
with head towards the nearest bank. The current
carried him down-stream, but his inshore
progress was swift and certain. A huge yell
came from the admiring spectators as the <i>Silas
P. Young</i> pursued her course and rounded another
bend.</p>
<p>Angela, stunned and terrified by this unexpected
precipitation into ice-cold water, lay like
a log with eyes closed. She lost all account of
time in the mental paralysis that gripped her....
Only when they touched bottom and Jim
commenced to carry her to the bank did her full
sense come into operation. She stood in her
sodden clothing, her pale, beautiful face quivering
as she regarded this monster of a man.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You brute! You heartless ruffian! Oh, if I
could only make you feel what I think of you!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If I could only make you feel just what I
think of you!&#8221; he said slowly. &#8220;But we&#8217;re both
trying to do just what can&#8217;t be done. Let&#8217;s drop
it and find the hoss. Better foller behind, and
not try running away. Maybe you think it
amuses me to yank you back like this every time&mdash;but
it don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>He began to tramp along a beaten path that
wound up over the hill. Angela followed, with
swift steps, for a cold wind blew down the valley
and set her teeth chattering. Overhead thick
gray clouds obliterated the sun. A mile farther
on Jim stopped and, slipping off his coat, went
to her.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re cold. Put it on.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No&mdash;thanks.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Put it on!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why this sudden regard for my welfare?&#8221;</p>
<p>It was like a stab to him. She saw it and was
pleased. But later on she was a little ashamed
of that throb of transient joy. She would have
liked to express her regrets, but her pride prevented
such a descent.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span></p>
<p>They found the horse, pawing impatiently at
the ground. He whinnied plaintively as he heard
Jim&#8217;s footfall and the call that the latter&#8217;s lips
gave utterance to. Without a word Jim lifted
Angela into the saddle and mounted behind her.
A &#8220;cluck&#8221; from his lips, and the mare went
galloping across the uneven country towards
Red Ruin. They arrived there just as the first
flakes of snow began to fall.</p>
<hr class='minor' />

<p>For a whole week no single word passed
between them. The first snow had come, and
every day found the thermometer registering a
lower temperature. In a week or two the whole
land would be in the grip of the pitiless winter.
What were Jim&#8217;s intentions? She saw him
pondering over a map and marking routes.
After a trip into Dawson he came back with a
team of dogs and a new sled, plus dog-feed,
snow-shoes, and sundry other gear. One evening
he broke the silence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Angela!&#8221;</p>
<p>She lifted her head from the book that she
was reading.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re hitting the trail to-morrow.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span></p>
<p>&#8220;To where?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;North&mdash;the Chandalar River district. There&#8217;s
nothing left worth staking down here. But
there&#8217;s gold up there, and we can&#8217;t afford to
waste time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; she said icily, and turned to the
book again.</p>
<p>He put his arm across and closed the book.</p>
<p>&#8220;Better git this thing clear.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it clear?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nope. Listen here&mdash;we got enough grub to
carry us over the winter, that and no more. My
last wad of dollars went to buy them dawgs. I
guess you think I&#8217;m trash, and perhaps I am, but
up here in the North men stick by their pardners
till they strike gold or leave their bones on the
trail. You&#8217;re my pard now&mdash;won&#8217;t you act on
that and make the best of it?&#8221;</p>
<p>Her eyes shone defiantly in the glare of the
paraffin lamp. Appealing to her sense of justice
was useless in the face of circumstances.</p>
<p>&#8220;You call it partnership when the one is
forced against her will, and the other uses every
kind of diabolical means to assist his mastery? I
am coming with you because there is no way out
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span>
of it. You understand. Nothing but force can
save me&mdash;I see that. Your code of life is based
on brute strength devoid of any kind of moral
sense.&#8221;</p>
<p>His lips moved in a way that evidenced his
resentment.</p>
<p>&#8220;What you call &#8217;moral sense&#8217; is a pretty queer
thing, I allow. It lets a man sell his daughter
for hard cash, and it lets that daughter play with
a man&#8217;s feelings. If that&#8217;s moral sense I ain&#8217;t
takin&#8217; none.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you never forget that? Do you think I
would have gone on with that had I believed you
misinterpreted the whole thing?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Misinterpreted! Say, do your kisses allow
of misinterpretation?&#8221;</p>
<p>She was amazed at this quick and telling
thrust. She had yet much to learn about Colorado
Jim. Education is a matter of mind, independent
of environment. She made the mistake
of believing it to be the special monopoly of high-schools
and gentle breeding. She was unable to
recognize the diamond in its crude unpolished
state.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span></p>
<p>&#8220;When I kissed you, did you think that was
a kind o&#8217; habit with me?&#8221; he queried.</p>
<p>She shrugged her shoulders, not wishing to
remember the incident.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was the first time anything like that had
happened to me,&#8221; he resumed, &#8220;and it was like
touching heaven while it lasted. But I see now
there was nothing in it&mdash;no more than kissing
one of them saloon women&mdash;&mdash; Ugh!&#8221;</p>
<p>She felt like striking him, in her anger, at the
insulting comparison, but she was not unconscious
of the truth of it.... She opened the
book again, and strove to forget his presence and
the approaching horror of Arctic wanderings.
She saw him pull the fur cap down over his ears,
and disappear through the tent opening to feed
the howling malemutes.</p>
<hr class='minor' />

<p>On the morrow they packed their tent, loaded
the sled with everything they possessed, and set
their head for the North. She sat on the sled,
clad in thick mackinaw coat, fur cap, and
mittens, whilst Jim stood behind with a twenty-foot
whip clasped in his hand. The mixed team
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span>
of twelve dogs snarled and snapped at each other
as they waited for the word of command.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mush&mdash;you malemutes!&#8221; cried Jim.</p>
<p>The long curling whip came down with a
whistling crack, and the team went trotting
across the dazzling white plain.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<h3>THE TERROR OF THE NORTH</h3>
</div>

<p>There is no stillness like the stillness of
the Arctic. In the frozen wastes of the
North the human voice is a blessed and
desirable thing. Imagine an ice-locked land,
stretching on either hand for thousands of miles,
with never a bird&#8217;s song to break the silence,
where nothing lives but a few starved wolves,
and consumptive Indians existing for the most
part in f&oelig;tid igloos, venturing out but rarely in
search of edible roots or an occasional indigenous
animal. Ninety per cent. of the human life of
Alaska was settled along the Yukon valley, in
close proximity to the vast artery that connected
with the outer world.</p>
<p>North of that the boundless wilderness
stretches away over plain and mountain to the
very pole. Traveling is slow and tortuous, for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span>
beaten trails are few, and the wanderer must
&#8220;pack&#8221; his own trail where the snow is deep&mdash;walking
in front of the sled and treading a negotiable
sled-track by means of snow-shoes.</p>
<p>The body craves for warmth, and warmth can
only be obtained by excessive consumption of
food. The normal ration of a healthy being is
trebled to counteract the enormous evaporation
of bodily heat. Fat is the staff of life. The
Esquimo, settled along the coast by the Bering
Sea, takes his meal of ten pounds of blubber and
feels a better man. By imitative methods the
white man survives the awful cold and the pitiless
conditions.</p>
<p>To Angela it seemed that every single discomfort
to which human life was subject was
epitomized in these appalling wastes. The ice
was yet new and river trails were unsafe. Day
after day they plowed through the deep snow,
ever Northward, with the wind in their teeth, and
the sun but a mere spectre mounting the horizon,
with an effort, to sink again but a few hours later.
The dogs frightened her. They were fierce,
untamed brutes who snarled at each other and
fought on occasion, until the stinging lash
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span>
descended on their thick coats to remind them
of the terrible master behind the sled. She came
to see how necessary was the whip. They
responded to that and that alone. Some of them
were half wolf&mdash;creatures that were the result of
inter-breeding on the part of Athabaskan
Indians. Like their wolf parent their energy
was immense. They ate but twice daily&mdash;enormous
meals of pulped fish and nondescript material
which filled two of the sacks on the sled.</p>
<p>They camped on bleak mountains and along
frozen creeks. In the latter case Jim made
double use of the camp-fire. Before retiring into
the snow-banked tent for the night the fire was
heaped high with branches. In the morning the
thawed ground beneath it was excavated and
washed with snow-water, lest it harbor the
much desired red mineral.</p>
<p>Muck! Always muck! It seemed to her
amazing that he should continue this heartbreaking
quest. Much as she had prized the
things that money could buy, she began to hate
it now. As they penetrated farther North, so
the conditions grew more appalling. No longer
the sun mounted the horizon. Night and day
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span>
were much the same thing&mdash;a mysterious luminiferousness,
merging into the fantastic lights of
the great Aurora Borealis, that occasionally
leapt across the Northern sky in spectrumatic
beauty, to flicker and die, and rise again.</p>
<p>Day after day the journey went on. The ice
being now strong, they skimmed across rivers
and creeks, raising the snow in clouds and
&#8220;switchbacking&#8221; over hummocks in a fashion
that under other conditions might have been exhilarating.
Then came the monotonous digging
and washing, with its inevitable unsuccessful
issue.</p>
<p>Striking the Yukon River at the &#8220;flats&#8221;&mdash;where
it is reputed to be thirty miles wide&mdash;they
followed its course for three weary days, until
Fort Yukon was passed and the junction of the
Chandalar River was made. It was while negotiating
the rough surface of Chandalar that the
&#8220;terror of the North&#8221; came down.</p>
<p>Jim heard it coming before Angela was aware
of any unusual sound. For two days there had
been no wind, saving a light zephyr that laid its
bitter finger on the exposed flesh. Now a legion
of devils were preparing for attack. A sound
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span>
like unto a human sigh broke the silence. It
died away and came again, a little stronger.
Immediately Jim pulled the &#8220;leader&#8221; dog to
the lift and cracked the long whip over the team.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mush, darn you, mush!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; inquired Angela, as an uncanny
groaning met her ears.</p>
<p>&#8220;The wind. Gee, but she&#8217;s going to raise the
dead!&#8221;</p>
<p>The high bank loomed up and the sled turned
a half-circle and came close under a protecting
bluff. Jim tied the team to a tree and ran forward
to Angela. She was standing terror-stricken
at the sound of the approaching monster.
Behind her was a huge snow-drift. He pointed
to the white mass, and shouted that his voice
might be heard above the Niagara of sound.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll sure freeze stiff unless we git inside
that&mdash;hurry!&#8221;</p>
<p>They bored their way into the crisp snow, like
dogs in a rabbit-hole. There was scarcely need
to urge Angela to use her strength. The noise
of the approaching blizzard was like to fifty
thousand shrieking devils. The little light that
remained was suddenly blotted out. At nearly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span>
a hundred miles an hour the solid mass of wind
and snow came roaring down from the mountains.
The whole earth seemed to reel under the
impact. Inside the sheltering snow mass it was
cold enough, but outside nothing human could
live. The dogs, familiar with this phenomenon
of the higher latitudes, had crawled into the snow
and would lie there until the noise subsided.</p>
<p>The two humans huddled up inside the snow
heard nothing and saw nothing. It was as if the
whole world had suddenly crashed into a sister
planet and was hurtling into space, a broken
mass. Hours passed and no change came.
Occasionally the snow-drift seemed to shift a
little, and Jim dreaded that some clutching
finger of the wind would tear the frozen morsel
of shelter from the cliff and drive it into thin air.
That were indeed the end, for at fifty degrees
below zero the Arctic hurricane is like a knife,
from whose murderous edge no escape is possible.</p>
<p>They crawled lower in the snow until they
reached the ice itself. It was suffocating, for
the wind had blown in the entrance and fresh air
was excluded.... Jim felt the body close to
him&mdash;it was still as death. A great fear swept
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span>
through him. She was not strong enough for
this trial&mdash;she was&mdash;&mdash;! He thrust his hand inside
the thick coat and felt the heart. It was
beating but slowly, and her hands were cold. He
clasped her to him and rubbed the face with snow,
growling like an animal in pain as the hideous
uproar continued.</p>
<p>She had nearly fainted; but another hour of
this poisonous incarceration and she would never
recover. He dare not attempt to get to the
fresher air. Outside it was certain death, and
any moment might assist the wind in carrying out
the task it seemed so determined to perform....
A piercing wind suddenly entered,
and the whole mass quivered. He realized that
the worst was about to happen&mdash;the snow was
moving. Before he could fix on his mittens the
snow and its two inmates were flung like a rifle-shot
across the ice. There was a thundering roar,
and the whole pile broke into a myriad parts.
Still clasping the unconscious Angela, he went
helter-skelter before the blast, pitching and sliding
on the ice. The power to think was leaving
him. Brain and body seemed numbed and out of
action. He was only conscious that he held
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span>
in his arms the thing from which not even this
murderous wind could sever him. He calmly
waited for the end&mdash;the dreamy, painless end
that freezing death would bring....</p>
<p>Then he suddenly gave vent to a choking cry
of joy. The wind had suddenly, marvelously
vanished. He heard it howling its way across the
land to the South. He dragged himself from the
ice and looked back. The Aurora was flashing
again and the sky was clear. The strange Arctic
light was settling down on the scene, turning the
snow-clad waste into mysterious colors. He
rubbed his frost-bitten hands vigorously with
snow and hurried up the river with Angela
clasped in his arms.</p>
<p>He found the sled overturned, some distance
from where he had left it, and hurriedly rigged
up the tent on a suitable place on the bank. In
a few minutes he had Angela inside, on a pile of
blankets, and was forcing brandy between her
lips. Seeing that she was reviving, he lit the oil
stove and went to round up the dog-team.</p>
<p>When he returned Angela was boiling the
kettle on top of the stove. She handed him a
cup of cocoa in silence. He took it without attempting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span>
to drink it. Her extraordinary recovery
amazed him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it all over?&#8221; she queried ultimately.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yep,&#8221; he gasped. &#8220;But it sure did blow
some.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;it&#8217;s a good job we were inside the snow-drift,&#8221;
she replied indifferently.</p>
<p>He put down the mug of cocoa that he had
taken up. Of all bewildering things this was the
most bewildering. She was acting again&mdash;acting
in her own subtle fashion. He came to the conclusion
that women were beyond his comprehension&mdash;and
Angela most of all.</p>
<hr class='minor' />

<p>On the next morning the temperature was
moderately high. They left the river and found
a good trail along the bank. Angela asked no
questions regarding his destination. She had got
beyond caring very much now. She determined
to adopt an attitude of cold indifference.</p>
<p>The sled was negotiating a bad piece of trail
when it suddenly stopped, and she heard an
ejaculation from behind her. She saw Jim step
down and examine something black in the snow.
She gave a little cry as he caught the black object
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span>
and pulled it up&mdash;it was a dead man, frozen as
stiff as a board.</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor devil!&#8221; muttered Jim. &#8220;I guess he
got caught in that wind.&#8221;</p>
<p>He searched through the pockets of the
mackinaw coat, but found nothing that would
act as a means to identification. He let the body
fall and covered it with snow.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t you going to bury him?&#8221;</p>
<p>He nodded and looked round him in expectant
fashion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Must have a shack or a tent round about.
He&#8217;s got no pack of any kind. If it was a tent,
likely enough it&#8217;s a hundred miles away by
now. If it was a shack it&#8217;ll be very useful&mdash;to
us.&#8221;</p>
<p>She prayed it might be the latter. Anything
was better than this mad wandering.</p>
<p>They found the shack ten minutes later,
nestling in a hollow, with its chimney still
smoking. They pulled up outside and went to
investigate the home of the unfortunate stranger.
It was a comfortable affair, containing two
rooms and a small outhouse, plus a certain
amount of rough furniture. In the corner of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span>
outer room was the ubiquitous Yukon stove, with
a fryingpan on the top containing a much overdone
&#8220;flapjack.&#8221; A pair of snow-shoes lay in a
corner, and sundry articles of clothing were
hanging on nails. In the next room was a camp-bed
and more clothes, two bags of flour, one of
beans, a few tins of canned meat, a rifle and a
hundred cartridges&mdash;but no letters or information
of any kind respecting its late owner.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;ll do,&#8221; said Jim. &#8220;It&#8217;ll be better than a
tent, anyway.&#8221;</p>
<p>Angela agreed reluctantly. Somehow it
seemed heartless to coolly take possession of this
place, with its late owner lying dead but a bare
mile away. It gave her an uncanny sensation as
she glanced at all the little things that belonged
to him, that his cold hands had touched but a few
hours ago. She reflected that a year ago such an
incident as this would have chilled her with horror.
But apart from arousing a small amount of sentimentality
it affected her now very little. It came
as a shock to her to realize that fact&mdash;she was becoming
as wild as this &#8220;cowpuncher&#8221; husband of
hers, who even now was sallying forth with spade
and ax to excavate a shallow grave in the frozen
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span>
earth, to save a man&#8217;s body from prowling
wolves. And all without an atom of sentiment!</p>
<p>So little did she know of him! She did not see
him remove his cap as he gently placed the luckless
man in his last resting-place, or hear the
short whispered prayer that he uttered.</p>
<hr class='minor' />

<p>The dogs were unharnessed and driven into
the outhouse which was to serve as their future
domicile. Jim collected the dead man&#8217;s belongings
together and made a neat pile of them in
one corner of the outer room. Angela&#8217;s personal
things were taken into the more comfortable
inner room, which boasted of a match-boarded
wall&mdash;not to mention half a dozen rather indelicate
prints tacked on to the same.</p>
<p>When he had occasion to go into the room
again, after Angela had been there, he noticed
that the prints had been torn from the walls.
Angela was certainly very proper&mdash;for a married
woman!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<h3>THE BREAKING-POINT</h3>
</div>

<p>The weeks that followed were a testing-time
for Angela. Her resolutions
wavered and died, confronted as she was
by the terrible isolation and loneliness. Stoicism
was easy enough in theory but most difficult in
practice. The unchanging icy vista and the
eternal silence drove her to desperation. She
tried work as an antidote, and found it dulled the
edge of her despair.</p>
<p>They were fortunate enough to find a fish-trap
in the outhouse. Jim regarded this discovery
with great satisfaction. He chopped a hole in
the river ice and, baiting the trap with a canned
herring, managed to entice a &#8220;two-pounder&#8221; into
the wicker basket. Angela&#8217;s attempt to cook it
was not entirely a failure, and the repast was a
pleasant change from the eternal beans and pork.</p>
<p>Thereafter Angela took over the piscatorial
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span>
department. It meant going to the river each
morning and breaking the newly formed ice over
the fish-hole&mdash;a task that called forth all her
physical energy. At times the fish were scarce
and the journeys without result, but they were
not entirely wasted. She found that her body
glowed with the exercise and her soft arms began
to develop muscle.</p>
<p>Each day Jim took the sled and the dogs, and
explored the creek in the neighborhood. Farther
and farther afield he went, staying away at
nights and leaving Angela to the melancholia of
her soul. The shack seemed full of a strange
presence, a ghostly kind of ego that made itself
felt. Then along the valley came the bloodcurdling
howl of a wolf, to add to her terror and
misery.</p>
<p>The icehole froze up on one bitter night, and
all the efforts of Jim could not reach water again.
He eventually gave up the task as hopeless.</p>
<p>&#8220;Frozen right down to the river bed,&#8221; he
explained.</p>
<p>The great loneliness took deeper hold of her.
The eternal gloom began to affect her mentally.
She became the victim of prolonged fits of depression;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span>
Jim, tired and heavy-hearted with his
arduous wanderings, noticed the change in her.
It caused him acute mental agony, and not a
little self-reproach. At nights he pondered the
problem. Was he subjecting her to unjustifiable
misery? Had he a right to do this? He knew he
had not, but he was hoping&mdash;hoping vainly that
she might abandon that spirit of antagonism,
manifest in her every movement, and speak and
act as one human being to another. He grew
sick to realize that her will was no less strong
than his own. What was there left to do but take
her back and acknowledge defeat?</p>
<p>Defeat! The word aroused all his innate
stubbornness. Never had he acknowledged defeat
before. He had won through by sticking to
the task at hand. Was he to give in now&mdash;to let
this frozen-hearted woman beat him all round?
How Featherstone would purr with pleasure
when he knew! How all those high-browed
aristocrats would congratulate this ill-treated
wife on disposing of her unfortunate husband!</p>
<p>The old grievance still rankled, and his refusal
to forget it reacted upon himself. This wilderness
of great cold and hardship could not break
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span>
his endeavor, but a woman was slowly and surely
doing so. All his dreams evolved around her&mdash;maddening
dreams in which he was grasping and
missing her....</p>
<p>The climax was to come, and it came in a way
that was totally unexpected. It came with such
crushing relentless weight that it left him a mere
wreck of a man.</p>
<p>For three days Angela had spoken no word.
When he arrived back at the shack after the
usual vain hunt for gold, she gave him but a
quick glance, sufficient enough to convey to her
that he had failed for the hundredth time. On
the third night, instead of handing him his meal
from the stove she sat down and burst into
passionate sobs.</p>
<p>Instinctively he put out his hand to clasp her
trembling fingers. She pushed it away fiercely
and stood up, shaking with emotion.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got to let me go!&#8221; she cried.</p>
<p>&#8220;When the spring comes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, now. I can&#8217;t wait until the spring. This
is killing me&mdash;killing me. Can&#8217;t you see that it
will be too late then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Angela, we came for a set purpose. If I fail
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span>
when the spring comes, we&#8217;ll go back to the life
you want.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going now,&#8221; she said grimly. &#8220;To-night!&#8221;</p>
<p>His mouth tightened.</p>
<p>&#8220;Be reasonable!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Reasonable! You talk of reason&mdash;you who
brought me here to live like a dog, to treat as a
dog&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He sighed as he remembered her aversion to
any attempted acts of kindness on his part. In
every instance she had made it clear that she
wanted nothing from him&mdash;that she refused
kindnesses, sacrifices, on her behalf.</p>
<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t treated you in any way different to
that in which a husband would treat his wife.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wife&mdash;you call me that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you call it, then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Prisoner&mdash;slave!&#8221;</p>
<p>His face hardened.</p>
<p>&#8220;And if I did, ain&#8217;t there some justification?
If our deal had been a love deal I guess the
arrangement would have been canceled long
ago. But it wasn&#8217;t. It was commercial transaction
to which you gave your approval. It may
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span>
be morally wrong to keep you, but the whole
darned frame-up was morally wrong. So morals
don&#8217;t come into it&mdash;savvy? Legally I got a claim
to my&mdash;goods, and you&#8217;re asking me to forgo
that claim. But you don&#8217;t show much regret at
taking a hand in that dirty business&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I told you I was sorry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yep&mdash;sorry, because it&#8217;s hurting <i>you</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>She knew this was true, and the fact that he
knew it too stung her. She sunk her head in her
hands and remained for some time in silence.
When she raised it again her face was full of a
new determination.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are only bringing pain upon yourself,&#8221;
she said tensely.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can bear it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you?&mdash;I wanted to spare you&mdash;but you
are forcing me to this&mdash;forcing me to tell you
something that is going to hurt you.&#8221;</p>
<p>The tragic tone of her voice caused him to
stand as though petrified.</p>
<p>&#8220;I said I should go now&mdash;to-night; and I am
going.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So!&#8221; he stammered, feeling an awful pang
of fear at his heart.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You have hitherto considered no one but
yourself. How far will you carry your desire for
vengeance?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t get you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait! I told you it was killing me up here.
That didn&#8217;t seem to influence you much&mdash;but
suppose there is someone else to be considered&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you saying?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you blind? Can&#8217;t you guess? The other
person is as yet unborn.&#8221;</p>
<p>His eyes were blind with pain. He gripped a
chair and swayed dizzily. His mouth moved, but
uttered no sound. When at last he spoke the
words came as though forced from a clutched
throat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not that!&mdash;God, you don&#8217;t mean that? Tell
me you don&#8217;t mean that&mdash;Angela&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>She sank her head on her bosom and a sob
escaped her. The next moment her head was
jerked up and she was gazing into his steely fixed
eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Was it&mdash;that man&mdash;D&#8217;Arcy?&#8221;</p>
<p>Another sob convinced him. He flung her arm
aside and walked to the door. He had encountered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span>
hardships, disappointments, physical
and mental pain, but nothing like this devastating
destroyer that was gripping him. He
stumbled out of the shack like a terribly sick
man.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh God!&#8221; he groaned. &#8220;And I loved her!&#8221;</p>
<p>She had won&mdash;won by means so foul that he
would have died rather than that truth should
have become known to him. All life was rotten,
rotten to the core! Heaven was uprooted and
legions of devils usurped the throne of the
Almighty. He unlatched the outhouse and
feverishly harnessed six of the dogs to the sled.</p>
<p>Trembling and ill, he crept into the shack to
find her vanished to the inner room. He divided
up the food in two equal portions, placed half his
small financial funds inside a flour-sack, where
he knew she would find it, and piled the things
onto the sled. Then he called her in a low, almost
inaudible, voice. She came from the inner room,
closely swathed in furs and with her head sunk.</p>
<p>&#8220;The sled&#8217;s outside.... You can mush the
dogs.... They&#8217;re the tamest six.... Fort
Yukon is down the river, and the weather&#8217;s
good....&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span></p>
<p>She nodded and walked through the door. The
Arctic moon, shedding a queer blue radiance over
the snow hung high in the black vault. Directly
overhead the Great Bear gleamed like hanging
lamps, with magnificent Vega blazing like a rich
jewel. She turned to him once.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jim!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Go! Go! Follow the river.... Good&mdash;good-bye!&#8221;</p>
<p>A choking response came back. The whip
cracked and the dogs moved forward. In a few
minutes she was a black blur against the scintillating
snow. With a groan he turned about and
went inside.</p>
<p>For him it was a night of unparalleled agony.
Hour after hour saw him there, at the small
window, gazing fixedly up the valley, until a
slight increase in the light brought him to full
consciousness, to realize that a new day was
born.</p>
<p>He prepared a meal and, despite his lack of
appetite, managed to consume it. Then he took
the ax and the rip-saw and made for a bunch of
trees higher up the hill. All day the noise of
chopping and sawing broke the silence. By the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span>
evening, after a day of feverish and unremitting
toil, he had fashioned a satisfactory sled.</p>
<p>Sleep came to him then&mdash;the deep dreamless
sleep of exhaustion. But he awakened early, and
began to pack the sled with sufficient food for the
long journey. The six fierce brutes that remained
were fed and harnessed, and he again ran
over the details of his load to assure himself that
nothing was missing. At the last moment he
remembered the washing-pan and shovel, and
placed them with the other miscellaneous articles.</p>
<p>He had no dog-whip, but calculated he could
mush the dogs without that. He gave one glance
at the shack, emitted a fierce torrent of oaths,
and pushed the sled into action.</p>
<p>They went down the incline at a terrific rate
and bumped on to the river. Yonder lay Dawson
and D&#8217;Arcy. Whatever happened, he meant to
get D&#8217;Arcy, if it meant taking the Pole <i>en route</i>.
Out of this anticipation he derived some grain of
pleasure&mdash;and he needed it to leaven the misery
in his soul. His hand moved to the revolver in
the pocket of the big bearskin coat, only to be
withdrawn before he touched it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nope&mdash;not that way,&#8221; he muttered grimly,
&#8220;but with my two hands.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
<h3>THE QUEST</h3>
</div>

<p>It was a weary and travel-stained man that
drove a dog-sled into Dawson a fortnight
later. The team was like the &#8220;musher,&#8221; lean
and wild-eyed, after their four hundred miles of
merciless driving. Through wind and snow this
man had kept the trail. Sleep became a thing
unknown during the latter stages of the journey.
He expected to find D&#8217;Arcy in Dawson&mdash;and
the desire to meet D&#8217;Arcy had grown into a craving.
He had half killed the dogs and himself in
this mad journey, but the incentive was tremendous.</p>
<p>How he missed her! Despite her soul-withering
confession, he found himself building up visions
of her in his brain. Life had become suddenly
hopelessly blank, brightened by one thing&mdash;the
desire for retribution upon the head of the
man who had smashed his idol.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span></p>
<p>Man, sled, and dogs went hurtling down the
street&mdash;a black mass in the falling snow. He
handed them over to a man at the Yukon Hotel
and mixed with the crowd in the gaming saloon.
No one seemed to know anything about D&#8217;Arcy,
so he inquired for Hanky Brown. Hanky was
at length run to earth in a dance-hall.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gosh, it&#8217;s Colorado Jim!&#8221;</p>
<p>The latter hurled at him the question that
obsessed him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s D&#8217;Arcy?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;D&#8217;Arcy? Who in hell is D&#8217;&mdash;&mdash; Gee, I got
you. You won&#8217;t find D&#8217;Arcy in Dawson. He&#8217;s
up in Endicott somewhere.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim&#8217;s face fell. Endicott was north of the
Chandalar River. It meant another journey of
five hundred miles back beyond the place where
he had come.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re certain, Hanky?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure. Ask Tony.&#8221; He turned round and
beckoned a man from the back of the hall.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Member that swell guy they called D&#8217;Arcy&mdash;didn&#8217;t
he go with Lonagon and Shanks on that
Northern trip?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yep. Struck a rich streak up there&mdash;so I
heered. Why, what&#8217;s wrong?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothin&#8217;,&#8221; said Jim. &#8220;I was just kinder
anxious to see him. I guess I&#8217;ll get along.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hanky was gazing at him curiously. He felt
that something was wrong, but couldn&#8217;t lay his
finger on the trouble.</p>
<p>&#8220;You ain&#8217;t going up to Endicott?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe I am.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s sure a hell of a journey just now, and
you ain&#8217;t likely to find that man among them
hills.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll find him all right, Hanky. Are you
clearing out next spring?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. Gotta quarter share in &#8217;26 below&#8217; on
Black Creek. We sold out yesterday to the
Syndicate. The missus&#8217;ll be crazed when she
hears. And how about you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No luck. I don&#8217;t think I was born lucky,
Hank. I used to think so&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Hanky shook his head and pointed to the untasted
spirit in Jim&#8217;s mug.</p>
<p>&#8220;Drink up!&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim quaffed the vile spirit and fastened the
chin-strap of his cap.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Jim, don&#8217;t go to Endicott.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t. You&#8217;re looking ugly, boy, and things
are done sudden-like when you&#8217;re that way.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim gave a harsh laugh and his eyes flashed
madly. Then he stopped, biting off the laugh
with a snap of his teeth.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are some crimes for which there ain&#8217;t
no punishment but one, Hanky. There&#8217;s no
power on this earth, bar death, that&#8217;ll stop me
from gitting D&#8217;Arcy. If I don&#8217;t come back before
the break-up you can take it that he saw me
coming before I got him.&#8221;</p>
<p>He thrust his hands into the big mittens
strung to his shoulders, and nodding grimly went
through the door. Ten minutes later he was
cracking the new dog-whip over the backs of his
yelping team, and mounting the high bank heading
for the North once more.</p>
<p>There is nothing more exciting than a manhunt
when the pursuer is convinced that his
cause is just, and the punishment he intends to
inflict well-merited. Jim, peering through the
blinding snow, saw in imagination the man he
sought, all unconscious of the swift justice that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span>
was coming to him from out of the wilderness.
This was man&#8217;s law, whatever the written law
might be. Not for one instant did his determination
waver or his conviction falter. D&#8217;Arcy had
partaken of forbidden fruit&mdash;partaken of it consciously,
without regard for any suffering it
might cause to others&mdash;and D&#8217;Arcy must pay the
penalty!</p>
<p>It was a primitive argument and one that
appealed to passions, but he was in many respects
still a primitive man, with primitive ideas
of right and justice. That law was good enough.
It had served through all his experience of
Western life, and would serve now!</p>
<p>The storm developed in fury, but still he drove
the howling, unwilling dogs into the teeth of it.
Icicles were hanging from his two weeks&#8217; growth
of beard, and thick snow covered him from head
to foot. Extraordinary luck favored him, for
the snags and pitfalls were innumerable, and any
deviation from the old obliterated trail might
launch the whole outfit down into an abyss.
Fortunately he struck the river again without
such a catastrophe happening.</p>
<p>The snow ceased to fall and the sky cleared.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span>
The red rim of the sun peeped over the horizon,
flooding the landscape with translucent light.
Before him lay the snow-clad Yukon, broad and
gigantic, running between its high wooded banks,
contrary to all precedents, Northwards.</p>
<hr class='minor' />

<p>Amid the maze of peaks and valleys, high up
on the Endicott Mountains, a strange affray was
taking place. In a small hut, sandwiched between
two perpendicular ice-walls, three men
crouched at holes newly bored through the log
sides. They were D&#8217;Arcy and his two companions,
Lonagon and Shanks.</p>
<p>It was Lonagon who had first struck gold in
this desolate region, late in the summer, whilst
engaged in hunting caribou. Shanks had gone
in with him on a fifty-fifty basis, but both lacked
the wherewithal to finance a trip so far North.
Against their desire they were obliged to take in
a third person. D&#8217;Arcy, having assured himself
that Lonagon was no liar, put up the money to
buy food and gear and joined in. The idea was
to thaw out the frozen pay dirt all through the
winter, and to wash it when the creek ran again.
Unlike the claims nearer Dawson, it made small
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span>
appeal to the big Capitalized Syndicate. Lonagon
was of opinion that more gold could be
washed out in one season than the Syndicate
would be willing to pay as purchase price.</p>
<p>Lonagon&#8217;s optimism had been vindicated.
The pay streak seemed to run along the whole
length of creek.</p>
<p>&#8220;It sure goes to the North Pole!&#8221; ejaculated
Shanks gleefully.</p>
<p>D&#8217;Arcy realized that he had struck a good
proposition. They built the rough hut and commenced
their awful task. Day by day the dump
of excavated pay dirt grew larger. They tested
it at times to find the yield of gold ever-increasing.
At nights they sat and talked of the future.
Shanks and Lonagon were for running a big
hotel in San Francisco. That seemed to be
their highest ideal, and nothing could shift them
from it.</p>
<p>The fact that each of them would in all probability
possess little short of a million dollars
made no difference whatever. They were set on
a drinking-place&mdash;where one could get drink
any hour of the night without having to knock
folks up, or even to get out of bed for it!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span></p>
<p>D&#8217;Arcy was planning for a life of absolute
luxury. He had been poor from birth&mdash;the
worst poverty of all, coupled as it was with social
prominence. He glowed with pleasure as he
looked forward to a time when moneylenders and
dunning creditors would be conspicuously
absent.</p>
<p>It was Shanks who brought the trouble upon
them. Shanks had hit upon a Thlinklet encampment
a mile or two down the creek. There were
about a dozen mop-headed, beady-eyed men,
and some two dozen women&mdash;two apiece&mdash;and
children. Shanks in his wanderings after adventure
had met a more than usually attractive
Thlinklet girl. She had not been averse to his
approaches and it ended in a pretty little love-scene,
upon which the husband was indiscreet
enough to intrude. Having some hard things to
say to Shanks, who unfortunately for the devoted
husband, knew a lot of the Thlinklet dialect, and
who resented aspersions upon his character
from an &#8220;Injun Polygamist,&#8221; the latter
promptly shot him.</p>
<p>The girl screamed with terror, and the Thlinklet
community ran as one man to the scene of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span>
the tragedy. Shanks, reading swift annihilation
in their eyes, promptly &#8220;beat it&#8221; for the hut.</p>
<p>They were now in the midst of their trouble.
All the Indians had turned out armed to the
teeth. Not unskilled in the art of war, they had
garbed themselves in white furs, presenting an
almost impossible target for the men inside the
hut. A spokesman had come forward demanding
the body of Shanks, and was told to go to
blazes. They now crept along the deep ravine
spread out over the snowy whiteness.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish you&#8217;d kep&#8217; your courtin&#8217; till we got to
&#8217;Frisco,&#8221; growled Lonagon.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t even kiss the gal!&#8221; retorted Shanks.
&#8220;I was jest telling her&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a report from outside, and a rifle-bullet
whizzed within a few inches of his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gee, they&#8217;ve got guns!&#8221; exclaimed Lonagon.
&#8220;That&#8217;s darn unfortunate!&#8221;</p>
<p>D&#8217;Arcy crept forward and, squinting through
the small loop-hole, fired twice. He gave a grunt
of great satisfaction.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s one less.&#8221;</p>
<p>A fusillade of shots came from the ravine.
They ripped through the thick logs and out the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span>
other side. D&#8217;Arcy drew in his breath with a
hiss.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll get us when the light goes,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hell they will!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Looky here,&#8221; said Shanks, &#8220;let&#8217;s hike out
and get at &#8217;em. Can&#8217;t shoot through these little
slits.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re about four to one&mdash;and there are at
least six rifles there,&#8221; said D&#8217;Arcy.</p>
<p>Shanks sneered.</p>
<p>&#8220;They couldn&#8217;t hit an iceberg.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Reckon they could, with an arrow,&#8221; growled
Lonagon. &#8220;We&#8217;d be crazed to go out there.&#8221;</p>
<p>D&#8217;Arcy was for following Shanks&#8217; advice.
They debated the point for a few minutes and
then decided to attempt an attack. But the
decision was made too late. There came a diabolical
yell down the ravine. Shanks ran to a
loop-hole.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gosh!&mdash;they&#8217;re coming&mdash;the whole lot of
them!&#8221; he cried.</p>
<p>The three men ran to their posts and commenced
firing at the leaping figures of the
Thlinklets. Three or four of them bit the snow,
but the remainder reached the hut. Shots came
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span>
through and the sound of hatchets sounded on
the thick logs.</p>
<p>D&#8217;Arcy fired and a scream of anguish followed.
Then he threw up his arms and fell back
with a groan, his rifle sticking in the slit through
which it had fired. Shanks ran to him, and saw
a round hole through his coat, near the heart,
around which the blood was freezing as it issued.
There was obviously nothing to be done with
D&#8217;Arcy. Shanks dragged the rifle from the hole
and reloaded it, cursing and swearing like a madman.
Still came the steady thud, thud of the
hatchets, but they rang much more hollow, and
the two defenders expected to see part of the wall
go down at any moment. Suddenly the sound of
hatchets ceased and some of the noise subsided.
Lonagon peeped through a crack, and saw half
a dozen Indians coming up with a battering-ram
in the shape of a felled tree. They approached
at a wide angle, out of the line of fire.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shanks, it&#8217;s all up. Get your six shooter&mdash;we&#8217;ll
have the black devils inside in a minute.&#8221;</p>
<p>Shanks flung down the rifle and snatched the
revolver from his belt. He bent low and took a
glimpse at what was happening outside. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span>
Indians were but twenty yards away, and preparing
to charge the half dissected portion of
the wall with their heavy ram. He tried to get
a shot at them, but could not get enough angle
on to the revolver.</p>
<p>He saw them ambling towards him, and then,
to his surprise, one of them gasped and pitched
headlong. The remainder stood, transfixed, at
this inexplicable occurrence. Before they recovered
from their amazement another man
howled with pain and placed one hand over a
perforated shoulder. From afar came the sharp
crack of a firearm. Shanks suddenly saw the
shooter, high up on the ice wall above them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gee whiz! Lonagon&mdash;it&#8217;s a big feller up on
the cliff! Whoever he is, he&#8217;s got Buffalo Bill
beaten to a frazzle. Did you see that? A bull&#8217;s-eye
at three hundred feet, and with a six-shooter.
It clean wallops the band!&#8221;</p>
<p>He unbarred the door, as the remaining
Thlinklets went helter-skelter down the ravine,
and waved his hands to the figure above him.
Lonagon turned to the still form of D&#8217;Arcy. He
lifted the latter on the camp-bed, poured some
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span>
whisky between his teeth, and saw the eyes open
and shine glassily.</p>
<p>&#8220;How&#8217;s it going?&#8221; he queried.</p>
<p>D&#8217;Arcy gave a weak smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m finished with gold-digging, Pat. It&#8217;s a
rotten shame to have to let go just when luck has
changed ... but that&#8217;s life all over.... I&#8217;m
cold&mdash;cold.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lonagon, who recognized Death when he saw
it coming, pulled some blankets over D&#8217;Arcy and
turned moodily away. His was not a sentimental
nature. Forty years in the North had killed
sentiment, but he liked D&#8217;Arcy&mdash;and it hurt.
He went out to get a sight of their unknown ally.</p>
<p>He found him and his hungry, grizzled team
coming down the ravine with Shanks. It was
Jim&mdash;but scarcely the Jim of old. For a month
he had traveled up from Dawson and among the
merciless peaks, eating but half rations and
fighting storm and snow with all the power of
his indomitable will. He looked like a great
gaunt spectre, with hollow cheeks and eyes that
shone in unearthly fashion. Shanks could not
make head or tail of him. His proffered hand
had been neglected and his few questions went
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span>
unanswered. He was pleased when Lonagon
turned up, for he had a deadly fear of madmen.</p>
<p>&#8220;What cheer, stranger!&#8221; cried Lonagon.
&#8220;You turned up in the nick of time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim stopped the sled and regarded him fixedly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you&mdash;Lonagon?&#8221; he asked in a husky
voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then where&#8217;s D&#8217;Arcy? I want D&#8217;Arcy.
D&#8217;ye git that? It&#8217;s D&#8217;Arcy I&#8217;m after.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lonagon looked at Shanks. Shanks tapped
his forehead significantly to indicate that in his
opinion the stranger had left the major portion
of his senses out on the trail, and wasn&#8217;t safe
company.</p>
<p>&#8220;So&mdash;you want D&#8217;Arcy?&#8221; quavered Lonagon.</p>
<p>&#8220;I said so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wal, you&#8217;re only jest in time. Come right
in and see for yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim reeled across to the cabin and hesitated on
the threshold.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s kinder private,&#8221; he growled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, like that, is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>Lonagon began to smell a rat. He pursed his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span>
lips and met Jim&#8217;s flaming eyes. Undaunted, he
placed his back to the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;See here, we&#8217;re mighty obliged to you for
plugging them Injuns, but you ain&#8217;t going in
there till we know what your game is. You ain&#8217;t
safe&mdash;there&#8217;s a skeery look in your eyes and&mdash;&#8221;
he lowered his voice&mdash;&#8220;D&#8217;Arcy is hitting the
long trail.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim started back in amazement. The news
brought him the bitterest disappointment he had
yet suffered. After all this terrible time on the
trail fate was to rob him of his reward! For a
moment he became suspicious.</p>
<p>&#8220;So he put you up to that, eh? Better stand
away. I ain&#8217;t in a humor for hossplay. We
got a score to settle.&#8221;</p>
<p>Shanks stepped up to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;That score will be settled in less&#8217;n an hour.
The Injuns got D&#8217;Arcy over the heart. Go in
and see. I reckon you&#8217;ll find there&#8217;s no need to
settle scores.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lonagon, realizing that nothing could worsen
D&#8217;Arcy&#8217;s condition, turned away and watched
Jim enter the cabin.</p>
<p>Once inside the door, Jim saw that the two
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span>
men had spoken the truth. D&#8217;Arcy&#8217;s deathly
white face was turned towards him and the hands
were clenched on the brown blanket. Providence
was robbing him of his vengeance, and despite
his crushing sense of failure, somewhere in his
heart leapt a great gladness. He approached
the bed, and the sound of his heavy tread awoke
the dying man to consciousness. He turned his
glassy eyes on his visitor, and for a moment
failed to recognize him. Then memory came.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&mdash;you are the man&mdash;I saw&mdash;on the bank
at Dawson.... Angela&#8217;s husband!&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim nodded grimly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve come,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Didn&#8217;t you know I&#8217;d
come?&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<h3>THE GREAT LIE</h3>
</div>

<p>D&#8217;Arcy regarded him fixedly. It astonished
him that a man should travel hundreds
of miles in the Arctic winter to
vent his wrath on another.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why should you come?&#8221; he murmured.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&mdash;you ask me that! You&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He stopped as a spasm of pain crossed
D&#8217;Arcy&#8217;s face. In the presence of impending
Death he found a strange difficulty in giving full
vent to his hate.</p>
<p>&#8220;I see,&#8221; gasped D&#8217;Arcy. &#8220;It&#8217;s because I
helped her to escape. Perhaps I was wrong, but
believe me, it was better that way. I knew her
years ago.... It gave you pain, but it
may have saved her from hating you&mdash;eventually....&#8221;</p>
<p>This seeming hypocrisy staggered Jim. That
any man facing the shadow of Death could act
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span>
in such manner was amazing. He quivered with
violent repulsion.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wasn&#8217;t referring to that,&#8221; he snapped.
&#8220;She didn&#8217;t escape&mdash;I brought her back.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&mdash;you brought her back! Then why did
you come here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I came to kill you&mdash;with my hands. Did you
think I would rest until that score was settled?&#8221;</p>
<p>D&#8217;Arcy attempted to drag himself into a sitting
position, but the pain it caused him rendered
the attempt vain. He closed his eyes for a few
seconds, then slowly opened them. He became
conscious of the fact that they were at cross-purposes.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t understand.... In any case you
are too late.... But why do you want to kill
me? What I did, I did for the sake of friendship.
I don&#8217;t doubt you would&mdash;do the same for
a woman in trouble&mdash;if&mdash;if you loved her.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim passed his hand across his brow. It was
bewildering, baffling!</p>
<p>&#8220;God, ain&#8217;t you got a soul?&#8221; he gasped. &#8220;Can
you lie there within a few minutes of death and
take a pride in what you did? Damn the fate
that got you plugged before I could get my
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span>
hands on you. I suffered hell out there, these
two months, hunting you all over the mountains,
and now ...&#8221;</p>
<p>D&#8217;Arcy surveyed the distraught speaker in
bewilderment. He had said that Angela had
been brought back from the <i>Silas P. Young</i>.
Then it wasn&#8217;t that escape that had sent him up
here in bitter, revengeful mood. He began to
touch the outer edge of the truth.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m cold,&#8221; he muttered. &#8220;And it grows
dark.... Where are you?... I must know
more, ... tell me what troubles you.... Do
you think there was anything more in that
business but friendship? Speak!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah&mdash;I see.... So that&#8217;s it.... See here,
friend.... I&#8217;m going out ... right out,
where perhaps there&#8217;s a tribunal.... I&#8217;ve done
bad things, but not that.... I&#8217;m glad you came
... in time. And you thought that of me&mdash;O
God!&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim recoiled with blanched cheeks before these
words, ringing as they did with truth. He tried
to get a clear grip of the position, but his brain
reeled under the force of this astounding dénouement.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span>
D&#8217;Arcy was speaking again&mdash;so faint he
could scarcely hear.</p>
<p>&#8220;And to think that of&mdash;her! Man&mdash;man&mdash;and
you look as though you love her.... She&#8217;s
all that&#8217;s good and pure, though her pride is&mdash;great,
too great,... and she&#8217;s willful and unrelenting....
Go back and put this right.
Don&#8217;t let this terrible unjust suspicion remain....&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But&mdash;she told me that,&#8221; gasped Jim.</p>
<p>Despite the pain occasioned by the movement,
D&#8217;Arcy dragged himself higher on the pillow
and gazed at Jim in horror.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&mdash;she told you&mdash;that!&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim wished he had bitten his tongue off before
those words had been uttered. Was ever physical
blow more cruel than this&mdash;to inflict insult
and guilt of so despicable a nature upon a perfectly
innocent man! He snatched at the nerveless
hand on the bed and held it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry,&#8221; he groaned. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t know&mdash;I
didn&#8217;t think she would frame up a dirty lie like
that.&#8221;</p>
<p>D&#8217;Arcy suddenly smiled wistfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;And where is she now?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I sent her away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You sent her&mdash;well, perhaps it was best,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;You&#8217;ve got to forget that story. Circumstances
excuse many things.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They don&#8217;t excuse that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think they do.... All the blame is not
with her. That she should give utterance to such
a lie proves to what extremes she was forced.
She tried by every other means to escape&mdash;and
failed. You held her, not by love, but by brute
strength.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t understand,&#8221; retorted Jim. &#8220;I
bought her. She knows that. I didn&#8217;t know I
was buying her, but she knew all the time&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&mdash;can&#8217;t buy a woman&#8217;s soul.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that got to do with it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Everything. It was her soul that writhed
under that jailership&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yep&mdash;and her soul that told that damned
lie.&#8221;</p>
<p>D&#8217;Arcy shook his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;You tried to win by the superiority of your
physical strength. Is that moral? Is it justifiable?
She had no other way to fight but by
subtlety and falsehood. Both ways are equally
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span>
detestable. Therefore it is not for you to condemn....
Tell Lonagon ... I&#8217;m going&mdash;going....&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim ran outside and brought in Lonagon and
Shanks. Before they could reach the bed the
soul of D&#8217;Arcy had flown from his pain-ridden
body. Lonagon put the blanket over the dead
man&#8217;s face, and Shanks made strange noises in
his throat.</p>
<p>&#8220;He was a white man, though he was a gentleman,&#8221;
muttered Lonagon.</p>
<p>Jim staggered to the door, dazed by the outcome
of this meeting. But his mind had cooled
down and the crazy desire for vengeance, now
vanished, left him a more normal creature. But
he felt sick and weary. The future seemed so
hopeless and blank. Had he the desire to search
for Angela and bring her back, his storm-wrecked
body would have refused. Lonagon approached
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;So you didn&#8217;t kill him?&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim glared.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wal, it&#8217;s jest as well, for I&#8217;d hev sure killed
you.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;d have been darned glad,&#8221; growled
Jim.</p>
<p>A great nausea overtook him, and he clutched
the door-post for support. Shanks looked at him,
and shook his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Better not hit the trail to-day. You got
fever.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m all right. I&#8217;ll be mushing back to my
shack. &#8217;Tain&#8217;t far&mdash;two days&#8217; run. So long!&#8221;</p>
<p>He went to the sled, untethered the dogs, and
sent them scuttling up the ravine. But the sickness
remained. His head seemed nigh to bursting
and all his limbs set up a chronic aching. He
vaguely realized that he was in the grip of
mountain fever, which had fastened on to his
abused body and was breaking him up.</p>
<p>He had estimated his journey back to occupy
two days, but he meant to do it in one. Illness
on the trail meant death, and little as Life meant
to him now, the natural desire to fight for it
mastered the inclination to lay down and succumb
to the fever and the elements.</p>
<p>Hour after hour the sled whirled along.
Once he stopped and mechanically gave the dogs
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span>
a meal. He became transformed into an automaton,
acting by some subliminal power that set
his direction correctly and assisted to maintain
his body in an upright position.</p>
<p>Only one part of his brain functioned, and that
part was memory. All the outstanding incidents
of his adventurous career passed before him in
perspective. He saw himself fighting and winning
from the time when first he had set out with
a gripsack to seek a fortune in the wide plains of
the West. At the end of this remarkable chain
of successes was the dismal picture of his present
failure. A woman, rather than suffer subjugation
at his hands, had perjured her soul in a
dreadful lie.</p>
<p>D&#8217;Arcy was right. Souls were not to be
bought or &#8220;broken-in.&#8221; He had won in the old
days because the primitive law prevailed in all
things. No longer did that work. Civilization
assessed man on a different basis. The Law of
the Wild had been superseded by other qualities&mdash;qualities
which, presumably, he did not possess.
It was a bitter enough awakening for him
to feel himself a failure. Wandering, half deliriously,
in a vicious mental circle he came
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span>
again and again to that point. He had failed in
the great test&mdash;he had failed to win the heart of
the woman he truly loved. So much for all those
physical attributes! They conquered women in
the stone age. They might conquer women now,
of a kind, but they were futile weapons to employ
against a modern woman, benefiting by centuries
of progress and culture, with fine mentality
and inflexible will.</p>
<p>What then were the qualities that counted?
Was it love? No, not love, for his bosom was
bursting with it. Not sacrifice, for he would
have died for her&mdash;and she must know it. Was
it Culture? Was it Education? Chivalry?</p>
<p>His tortured brain could find no answer. The
woman herself had faced that same inward tribunal.
To her, too, the obstacle was not quite
clear. But it was pride of birth. It saturated
her; it subjugated all passions, all emotions. It
rendered her incapable of exercising her real
feelings. She had placed the man low down in
the scale, and had kept him there by the mere
consciousness of this accident of birth.</p>
<p>The man behind the sled ceased to ponder the
enigma. His mind became a complete blank as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span>
the shack hove into sight along the valley. He
lurched from side to side as the dogs, scenting
their kennel, increased their speed.</p>
<p>The sled hit a tree, and flung him to the
ground, but the dogs went on. He raised himself
to his knees, his teeth chattering in ghastly fashion.
His half-blind eyes could just make out
the hut in the distance, a black smudge against
the pure white snow. With a great effort he began
to crawl towards his refuge.... His legs
felt like lead and soon refused to respond to the
weakened will that moved them.</p>
<p>He uttered a deep groan and collapsed in the
snow, his head buried in his great arms.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
<h3>A CHANGE OF FRONT</h3>
</div>

<p>For five days the fever raged, and then it
left him, a mere wreck of his former self.
All through that unconscious period the
strangest things had happened. Arms had lifted
him up from the pillow, and hands had fed him
with liquid foods. Some glorious half-seen
stranger had taken him under her care; but her
face was hidden in a queer mist that floated before
his eyes. At times he had tried to rise from
the bed, his unbalanced mind obsessed with the
idea of washing for gold, but those same strange,
soft hands had always succeeded in preventing
this&mdash;saving once.</p>
<p>On that occasion he actually succeeded in
getting from the bed and standing up. He carefully
placed one leaden leg before the other, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span>
was nearly on the threshold of the door when the
familiar apparition appeared.</p>
<p>&#8220;She doesn&#8217;t know&mdash;I&#8217;m wise to all that
happened&mdash;but I know. She had to do that&mdash;poor
gal!... I&#8217;ll jest go and tell her it&#8217;s all
right&mdash;not to worry none....&#8221;</p>
<p>Two supple arms caught him. He pushed
them away, rather irritably.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t butt in.... It&#8217;s her I&#8217;m thinkin&#8217; of&mdash;Angela.
She&#8217;s sure hard and cold and can&#8217;t
see no good in me,... but she&#8217;s got to be happy&mdash;got
to be happy.... Maybe she&#8217;s right. I&#8217;m
only fit for hosses and wild women....&#8221;</p>
<p>He found himself in bed again, and quite unconscious
of the fact that he had ever been out
of it; but he still continued to ramble on in
monotonous and eerie fashion, about Angela,
Colorado, fifty thousand pounds, and sundry
other things.</p>
<p>Full consciousness came early one morning.
He had been lying trying to piece together all
the queer things that floated to his brain through
the medium of his disarranged optic nerve. He
succeeded in arriving at the fact that there was
a bed and he was lying on it, and that the ceiling
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span>
was comprised of rough logs.... Then an arm
was placed behind his head and a mug of something
hot was placed to his lips. But he didn&#8217;t
drink. His sight was coming back at tremendous
speed. The hazy face before him took definite
shape. A pair of intensely blue eyes were fixed
on him, and red shapely lips seemed to smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;Angela!&#8221; he gasped.</p>
<p>She nodded and turned her eyes down.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it is I. Don&#8217;t talk&mdash;you are too weak.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I don&#8217;t understand. Why did you come
back?&#8221;</p>
<p>He saw the mouth quiver.</p>
<p>&#8220;I came back because&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Go on.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I came back because I told you a lie.... I
didn&#8217;t realize then what a despicable lie it was&mdash;one
that reflected upon the character of a good
friend, and made me seem like dirt in your eyes....
I wanted my freedom at any price, but
that price was too high.... I&mdash;I couldn&#8217;t go
and let you think&mdash;that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her shoulders shook, and he saw that she was
trying to conceal her sobs.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span></p>
<p>&#8220;When did you come back?&#8221; he queried in a
slow voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Two days after I left. I found you gone, but
knew you must come back, because some of the
gear was here.&#8221; She hesitated. &#8220;Did&mdash;did you
go after&mdash;him?&#8221;</p>
<p>He nodded grimly, and she gave a little cry of
terror.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&mdash;you found him?&#8221;</p>
<p>He nodded affirmatively.</p>
<p>&#8220;And then&mdash;&mdash;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I found him dying from a bad injury.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dying&mdash;&mdash;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. He&#8217;s dead now.&#8221;</p>
<p>She turned on him with horrified eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&mdash;you didn&#8217;t kill him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nope. I went there for that, but the Injuns
got him first.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tears swam in her eyes. She moved her hands
nervelessly and put the painful, crucial question.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did he know&mdash;why you came?&#8221;</p>
<p>He inclined his head, much affected by her
attitude of abject shame. She gave a smothered
cry and sank her head into her hands.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t, don&#8217;t!&#8221; he implored. &#8220;He understood
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span>
all right, and he&#8217;s dead and gone.
Forget it!&#8221;</p>
<p>He took the mug of hot cocoa, anxious to drop
a subject which caused him as much pain as it
did her. Through the frosted windows he could
see the sunlit, beautiful landscape, shining with
incomparable radiance. Soon the spring would
come, and with it the soul-filling song of birds,
breaking the long silence of the winter.</p>
<p>&#8220;It must be round about March,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I
sure have lost count of time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s March the third or fourth,&#8221; she replied.</p>
<p>He glanced round the room and was surprised
to notice its tidy appearance. All the domestic
utensils were clean and neatly arranged on
shelves, and the window boasted a pair of
curtains. He began to realize how near death
he must have been&mdash;so near, indeed, but for her
he would have crossed the abyss before this.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where did you find me?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Away back on the fringe of the wood. The
dogs came home with the sled and I followed the
tracks till I found you. I&mdash;I thought you were
dead.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you carried me here?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I unpacked the sled and went back with it.
I managed to get you on to it&mdash;the dogs did the
rest.&#8221;</p>
<p>He gave a low sigh.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll soon be up and about again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think you will. You are terribly weak&mdash;and
look so ill.&#8221;</p>
<p>He laughed weakly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t much of an invalid. You&#8217;ll see.&#8221;</p>
<p>She did see. His recovery was amazingly
rapid. He seemed to change hourly, making
new flesh at an astonishing pace. His iron constitution
performed miracles of transformation.
In three days, despite argument, he was out of
bed. On the tenth day he shouldered the shovel
and the washing pan and went out to a small
creek to hunt the elusive gold. But failure still
dogged him. He flung down the shovel and devoted
hours to thinking over the position. When
the pale sun began to sink behind the multicolored
peaks he came to a decision and tramped
back to the shack. A meal was awaiting him,
spread on a clean white cloth. He noticed that
the knives had been cleaned, and that a bowl of
water was heated ready for a wash, which he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span>
badly needed. It was a pleasant but astonishing
change. For the first time it brought a real sense
of &#8220;home.&#8221; He half regretted the decision made
but an hour before, but he meant to go through
with it, hurt how it might.</p>
<p>&#8220;Angela,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We&#8217;re packing up to-morrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>She looked at him queerly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where to?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dawson.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And then&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The break-up is coming, and there&#8217;ll be
boats out to San Francisco.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see. We are going back?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s about the size of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because you have failed?&#8221;</p>
<p>He tightened his lips and his eyes flashed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nope. I ain&#8217;t failed. I&#8217;ll never let this thing
beat me. I&#8217;ll git gold if I stay till I&#8217;m fifty&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you said we were&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I kind o&#8217; got it mixed. I meant that you
should go home. See here, I&#8217;ve got enough
dollars to get you back to England&mdash;and it&#8217;s
about time.&#8221;</p>
<p>She put down her knife and fork, and he saw
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span>
a queer light gathering in her eyes. He had
expected a look of joy and triumph, but it wasn&#8217;t
that.</p>
<p>&#8220;Listen,&#8221; she said. &#8220;A year and a half ago
you made a business deal. You bought me, with
my own consent, for fifty thousand pounds&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Cut that out,&#8221; he muttered. &#8220;I ain&#8217;t sticking
to that&mdash;now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I am.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That night when I escaped from you, by a
mean trick, I was glad enough&mdash;in a way. But
out there, in that cruel wilderness, I came to see
that a business transaction, properly conducted,
is a sacred affair. When one buys a thing, it
belongs to one until someone else can pay the
price. That&#8217;s the position, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nope. I can give away my property if I
wish.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not in this case.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hell I can!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hell you can&#8217;t!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because&mdash;I can&#8217;t accept anything from you.
Food is a different matter. You fixed the conditions
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span>
yourself&mdash;&#8216;fifty-fifty&#8217; you called it. And
that&#8217;s how it stands.&#8221;</p>
<p>He jerked his chair back and strode up and
down the shack. This unexpected swing of the
pendulum upset all his arrangements. He feared
she did not understand the true state of affairs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Things is different&mdash;I&#8217;ve failed,&#8221; he growled.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>We&#8217;ve failed</i>&mdash;you mean.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;m broke.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>We&#8217;re</i> broke,&#8221; she corrected.</p>
<p>Impatiently he caught her by the arms. He
lowered his voice to impress upon her the necessity
of carrying out his plan.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you see how we stand? Angela, I&#8217;m
asking you to do this. I&#8217;ve only that passage
money left. This ain&#8217;t the place for you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you discover that before?&#8221;</p>
<p>He bit his lips at the retort.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess I was looking at things squint-eyed.
I bin used to rough women who were born to
hardship&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>She flared up indignantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;And that&#8217;s just it. You want to make me less
than these&mdash;wild women. Women are women all
the world over. If they can suffer uncomplainingly,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span>
so can I. If they can dig gold and mush
dogs, so can I. I dug out there along the creeks
when you were ill and unconscious&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You dug&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; Words failed him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. I <i>won&#8217;t</i> appear contemptible in your
eyes. And I won&#8217;t accept gifts&mdash;not even of
freedom. You bought me and paid for me, and
the debt remains.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I didn&#8217;t buy your&mdash;soul.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;m not giving it you,&#8221; she retorted.</p>
<p>He sunk his head, feeling hopelessly beaten in
the argument. All the time he was conscious
of inward joy. To let her go was to suffer hell.
The sudden fierceness that leaped out from her
only increased his insatiable desire for her. She
seemed even more beautiful in the rôle of tigress
than in the old frigid pose of a Greek goddess.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have your own way,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I intend to. You fixed the laws and you
can&#8217;t abuse them. Fifty thousand pounds is a
lot of money&mdash;more, perhaps, than most men
would pay for me. But one day someone
may&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He clutched her and glared into her eyes in
deep resentment.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think I would give you up for
money?&mdash;my God!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You gave me your word,&#8221; she said. &#8220;You
never go back on your word&mdash;you said so.&#8221;</p>
<p>He uttered a groan.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was fifty thousand,&#8221; she said in level tones.
&#8220;I shall not forget.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Angela!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Plus ten per cent. interest,&#8221; she added
tensely.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
<h3>A GLEAM OF SUNSHINE</h3>
</div>

<p>Another week, and Jim had recovered
all his old strength. With the spring in
close proximity, and the food supply running
dangerously short, he spared neither himself
nor the dogs in his last feverish endeavor to
achieve success.</p>
<p>Angela&#8217;s attitude puzzled him not a little.
Since that fierce passage of words in the shack
she had made no single reference to the future.
She carried on the housekeeping with increased
zest. Never again were the breakfast plates
found unwashed at the next meal. She began to
take a pride in making the cabin as comfortable
as circumstances would allow, even going to the
trouble of seeking berried evergreens in the
woods and transforming these into table decoration.</p>
<p>Occasionally she went out to meet the disappointed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span>
Jim coming back from his fruitless expeditions,
and mushed the dogs while he sat on
the sled. It seemed that she had succeeded in
reconciling the situation&mdash;in making the best of
a bad job.</p>
<p>One morning Jim announced his intention of
exploring a small creek not a great distance from
the shack. He started off with shovel and pick
and the eternal washing-pan under a leaden sky.
It was then an idea came to Angela. On her
journey back from her abortive flight she had
noticed a creek which displayed all the characteristics
of those rich, shallow claims of which
the Klondyke yields so many examples. Why
not undertake a prospecting trip on her own
account? There was a spare shovel, pick, and
pan, and she had bored holes in frozen gravel
before. She decided to harness up the sled and
put her plan into execution.</p>
<p>At noon she started off with her team on the
eight-mile journey. A close study of the map
had convinced her that by taking the overland
route she would save at least two miles either
way. But her knowledge of maps was not great,
and she entirely neglected to take into consideration
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span>
the contour markings, which would immediately
have warned any experienced traveler
against such a passage.</p>
<p>The trail led up over a big hill and down a
ravine, and for a mile or two was good &#8220;going.&#8221;
Coming out of the ravine the configuration
changed. A jumbled mass of precipitous hills
and canyons confronted her. She drove the dogs
to an elevated point and looked before her. The
great serpentine river came to view, clearly outlined
by its wooded banks, and no more than two
miles distant. On the near side of the river ran
the creek she sought.</p>
<p>She gave a sigh of relief and urged the dogs on.
The road narrowed and ascended again. The
mountain-side fell away, and she found herself
on a narrow ledge with a vast chasm beneath.
She thought of turning back, but there was no
room to turn the dogs round. Catching her
breath, she went carefully forward. A few small
flakes of snow on her shoulders, and then the
inky sky began to empty itself. It came down
in a great mass, obliterating everything. A cold
terror began to possess her. In the blinding snow
she could not discern the path for more than a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span>
yard or two ahead, and by the side of her yawned
that dreadful chasm!</p>
<p>She edged in close to the perpendicular wall,
peering into the whirling mass of snow. The
dogs stopped, and she urged them on again,
knowing that the pass must soon descend to the
river.</p>
<p>Suddenly there was a fierce uproar among the
dogs. The sled jerked forward, and commenced
to move at tremendous speed. A slight wind
created a funnel-like opening in the dense white
cloud before her. She gave one long shriek of
horror at the sight which met her eyes. The sled
was on the very brink of a precipice! It hovered
there for a moment&mdash;just long enough for her to
fling herself sideways against the wall; then it,
and the team, vanished over the side, taking a
mass of snow down, down into the bottomless
depths.</p>
<p>She crouched against the wall, petrified by
what had happened. A thundering noise came
up from the black hole, reverberating through
the pass and over the mountains as sled and dogs
were hurled to their doom. She put her fingers
in her ears to keep out the dreadful sound.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span></p>
<p>It ceased, and the great silence came again.
Faint and sick, she realized that her left shoulder
was aching with intense pain through contact
with the rock wall.</p>
<p>There was nothing to be done but go back and
confess the catastrophe to Jim. She stood up
and commenced creeping along the dreadful
path. Her left arm was hanging in useless fashion,
setting up acute pain at the shoulder.</p>
<p>The full significance of her folly came to her.
She had driven a team of dogs worth at least a
thousand dollars to oblivion. Their chief means
of travel was gone, and hundreds of miles lay
between them and civilization. How could she
confess the loss to Jim? What would he say?</p>
<p>For an hour she plodded on through the deep
snow, her mind ranging over the past. Whatever
might be said of this wild husband of hers,
he had played the game as he saw it. She had to
admit this. Culture and breeding were very
desirable things, but had he not some other
natural quality which, at the least computation,
balanced these attributes? Could any man of her
own set have acted with greater respect for her
womanhood than he?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span></p>
<p>Until recently she had been no companion to
him&mdash;nothing but a continual drag on the wheel.
She had hurt him in speech and action. She had
deliberately set her mind on making clear to him
his cultural and moral inferiority. In return for
this he had given her to feel a complete sense of
safety. Sleeping within a few feet of him she
had never, for a moment, felt the slightest possibility
of molestation or intrusion on his part. It
had been easy to take this all for granted&mdash;because
he was a wild man and she was a cultured
woman. She had come to see that &#8220;wild men&#8221;
did not show such a refinement of consideration,
even though they might conceivably acknowledge
their social inferiority. She knew of no
other man with whom she could have entrusted
herself as she did with this one. Moreover, he
was her husband....</p>
<p>She was glad she was making things a little
more pleasant for him. She saw that his natural
gayety and <i>joie de vivre</i>, long subdued, were
again welling up within him. But yesterday she
had heard him singing, coming back from his
day&#8217;s unfruitful task. She knew herself to be the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span>
cause of that song. It was rather pleasant to reflect
upon.</p>
<p>Now she must tell him of the loss of the dog-team,
brought about by her impetuosity and disregard
for his position as leader of the expedition.</p>
<p>She came upon the cabin and entered it, to
find him still away. She took off her snow-covered
garments with great difficulty, for her
injured arm hurt her at the least movement.
She was putting the kettle on the stove when he
entered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gee! but I thought we&#8217;d done with snow,&#8221;
he ejaculated. &#8220;But I guess this is the last
drop.&#8221;</p>
<p>He shook off his muklucks and flung the bearskin
parkha into a corner. With his usual quick
introspection he noticed that something was
amiss.</p>
<p>&#8220;Anythin&#8217; wrong?&#8221; he queried.</p>
<p>He touched her on the injured arm and she
winced with pain.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, you ain&#8217;t hurt your arm?&#8221;</p>
<p>She nodded.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Jim, I&#8217;ve done an awful thing. I&#8217;ve lost the
dog-team.&#8221;</p>
<p>She saw him start, and realized the full extent
of the loss. To her surprise his furrowed brows
relaxed and he smiled whimsically.</p>
<p>&#8220;Things do sure happen at the wrong time.
But how did you manage that?&#8221;</p>
<p>She told him in low, self-reproachful tones,
and winced again as a movement of the injured
arm brought agony.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, that&#8217;s bad.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. I know. Without the dogs&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, darn the dogs! I meant your arm. It&#8217;s
hurting you a heap. Ain&#8217;t you had a look at it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not yet. It&#8217;s rather a job getting my dress
undone.&#8221;</p>
<p>He promptly walked across the room, and in a
few seconds came back with two huge red handkerchiefs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sit you down,&#8221; he ordered. &#8220;We&#8217;ll start on
this right now. How do you manage this
arrangement?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&mdash;it unbuttons at the back,&#8221; she stammered.</p>
<p>She felt his big inexperienced hand at work on
the buttons, and soon her dress was slipped over
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span>
the injured shoulder. A little hiss escaped him
as the round white arm came to view, with a
hideous black bruise around the shoulder-joint.
She stole one look at his face, and saw his perturbed
countenance surveying the injury.</p>
<p>&#8220;Move your arm a little&mdash;that way.&#8221;</p>
<p>She did so with a groan.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good&mdash;there ain&#8217;t nothin&#8217; broke.&#8221;</p>
<p>He soaked the handkerchief in cold water and
tied up the arm with astonishing skill. Then he
fashioned a sling with the other handkerchief,
and carefully bent her arm and tucked it inside
the latter.</p>
<p>&#8220;How&#8217;s that?&#8221;</p>
<p>She smiled gratefully.</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems much easier.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure! It&#8217;ll be fine in a day or two. You sit
down here and I&#8217;ll git some tea.&#8221;</p>
<p>Without waiting to see this order obeyed, he
ran to the stove and poked the fire into a blaze.
The singing kettle began to boil, and a few
minutes later they were having tea.</p>
<p>She watched him carefully, and knew that the
loss of the dogs was worrying him. Yet he had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span>
made so light of that, and so much of her comparatively
trivial injury!</p>
<p>&#8220;About them dawgs, Angela?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s kinder unfortunate, because grub&#8217;s low
and it&#8217;s a hell of a way to Dawson. I guess we&#8217;ll
have to pack up to-morrow and git going. We
can do a bit o&#8217; digging on the way back.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her eyes shone strangely.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was all my fault, Jim.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bound to happen at times,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Dawgs
is the silliest things. See here, you&#8217;re worrying
some over that, ain&#8217;t you now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I know what it means&mdash;to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It don&#8217;t mean nothin&#8217; so long as you didn&#8217;t
go over that cliff with &#8217;em. We&#8217;ll make Dawson
all right. I&#8217;ve bin up against bigger trouble
than this.&#8221;</p>
<p>He jumped up and commenced vigorously to
wash up the cups and saucers, talking rapidly all
the while and refusing to allow her to lend a
hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;I done this for years, back there in Medicine
Bow,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Gee, them were times! There
wasn&#8217;t water enough to make tea with in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span>
summer. Me and my two chums used to buy a
pail of water for twenty dollars. It had to serve
the three of us a whole day. We washed in it,
and then drank it&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ugh!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wal, if we&#8217;d drank it first we couldn&#8217;t have
washed in it after. I guess them chaps had logic.
When we <i>did</i> strike a spring, gold wasn&#8217;t in it for
excitement. It was like finding heaven. Hookey
swore he&#8217;d never touch whisky again, and he
didn&#8217;t until we hit the next saloon.&#8221;</p>
<p>She laughed merrily as he turned and dried his
wet hands.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s good to hear you laugh,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If
you&#8217;d only laugh sometimes, Angela, I wouldn&#8217;t
care a damn about short rations. I seen men
laugh on the plains when the chances were that
two hours later their scalps would be hanging at
the belts of Injuns. I was only a kid then ...
but laughing is a fine thing. You can&#8217;t beat a
man who laughs.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You used to laugh then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But not now!&#8221;</p>
<p>He stared out through the window.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m being beaten,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>She stood up and touched him on the arm.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;ll ever be beaten,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>He shook his head, almost fearful of meeting
those clear, beautiful eyes of hers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Only one thing in the world can beat me,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;And that is the thing which above all
others I&#8217;m mad to get; and it ain&#8217;t gold.&#8221;</p>
<p>He spent the evening packing up the gear and
the food that remained, ready for the journey
down the river. The home-made sled was again
requisitioned, after undergoing sundry repairs.
Late in the evening Angela, from the inner room,
called him. Nervously he went inside, to find
her with her wonderful hair flowing over her
shoulders and her dress half undone.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I can&#8217;t get it off,&#8221; she complained.</p>
<p>He attended to the stubborn buttons and
pulled the top down over her shoulders. On the
threshold of the door he called back.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-night, Angela.&#8221;</p>
<p>She stood surveying him intently, and then
came towards him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whatever lies before us, don&#8217;t think me ungrateful.
I&#8217;ll try to be a good comrade in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span>
future if you&#8217;ll let me. You&#8217;ve suffered so much....
It was never my wish that you should
suffer. Even a bought wife has&mdash;a soul.&#8221;</p>
<p>He saw the swell of her bosom below the pure
white shoulders. All her intoxicating beauty
seemed to be pleading to him. Her lips, made
for kissing, were like alluring blossoms of spring.
For a moment he stood drunk with passionate
desire. Then he touched her fingers lightly and
went outside.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
<h3>THE CRISIS</h3>
</div>

<p>It was spring on the Yukon&mdash;the radiant,
glorious spring that is sandwiched between
the intense winter and the dank, enervating
summer. Birds sang in the woods, their liquid
voices accompanied by the deep noise of the river,
belching its millions of tons of ice into the Bering
Sea. In the lower valleys the snow had vanished,
and the rich green carpet of the earth shimmered
in the clear sunlight.</p>
<p>South of Fort Yukon Angela and Jim were
threading their way through a pine-forest. Both
carried packs on their backs, for the sled had
been discarded but a few days before, having
served them faithfully for a hundred-odd miles.</p>
<p>Jim found a small clearing and slung the
huge pack from his shoulders. Angela discarded
her smaller pack and came to help him
rig up the tent.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Better than the winter, eh?&#8221; he queried, as an
inquisitive bird came and hopped around them.</p>
<p>&#8220;In many ways, but the winter&#8217;s wonderful
enough when one has grown acclimatized. I shall
never forget those mountains and the glory of the
sunset.... Are we far from Dawson?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Two hundred miles or so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And will the food last out?&#8221;</p>
<p>That was the crucial question. Until the river
traffic began the purchase of food was almost an
impossibility. She saw Jim&#8217;s face tighten, as it
had tightened every time she had broached the
subject. A week before he had insisted that the
remaining food be equally divided, since they
now both engaged in the search for gold&mdash;that
eternally elusive mineral that seemed as far away
as ever. The beans and flour and canned meat
had been duly apportioned, and placed in their
respective sacks. When they separated for the
day each took his food with him, cooking it in
primitive fashion in the open.</p>
<p>For the last few days Angela had been anxious
about Jim. He seemed to have changed in an
extraordinary manner. His cheeks were thinner
and his eyes looked dead. Yet he was merry
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260' name='page_260'></a>260</span>
enough when at nights they forgathered around
the fire and told their respective tales of vain
searching.</p>
<p>She was frying some beans over the fire when
he rose and pointed back through the wood.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess I&#8217;ll jest go along and prospect the lay
of the land from the hill,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;But aren&#8217;t you going to have something to
eat?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nope&mdash;not now. I ain&#8217;t hungry. I&#8217;ll be
back again in no time.&#8221;</p>
<p>She ate her meal reflectively. It was queer
that he should want to go to the hill, when but
recently they had passed over it and had taken
their bearings from the ice-laden river that lay
to the east! Despite his assurance of excellent
health she knew something was wrong with him.
But what?</p>
<p>A little later she followed the path he had
taken. The thickly grown wood was alive with
spirit of spring. Small animals scampered
underfoot, and overhead a bird breathed forth
its soul in incomparable song. She stopped for
a minute to listen to the latter&mdash;clear-throated
as an English nightingale&mdash;singing away as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261' name='page_261'></a>261</span>
though winter and the stark desolation had never
been. A slight breeze moaned among the tree-tops,
and woodland scents were wafted to her
nostrils. Adown the gale came the slanting rays
of the setting sun, red and wonderful and warm.</p>
<p>From near at hand came another sound&mdash;a
noise as of one slashing at the earth. Carefully
she made her way in the direction of the noise,
curious as to its meaning. She peered round a
tree, and saw something which took her breath
away. Jim was kneeling on the ground, hacking
with his jack-knife at the earth. Then from the
excavated foot or so he took a root, scraped it
with the knife, and began to gnaw it like a dog.
She had heard of edible roots, on which half-starved
Indians in the North managed to subsist
for long periods. But for Jim to do this....
Her brain reeled at the sight. The significance
of it dawned upon her. He was afraid of the
future. He knew the food could not last out,
and was saving his rations for the time of emergency.
That was the meaning of those thinning
cheeks and the dead eyes. He was famished with
hunger...!</p>
<p>With a choke she ran towards him, holding up
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262' name='page_262'></a>262</span>
her hands with horror. He tried to hide the root
he was chewing, but became aware that she had
seen it, and that she knew the true motive of his
expedition.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jim, why, you&#8217;re starving! Why didn&#8217;t you
tell me?&#8221;</p>
<p>He stood up and put the knife into his pocket.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tain&#8217;t as bad as all that,&#8221; he said casually.
&#8220;Gotta make that grub pan out, somehow. I
told you I was rough&mdash;an animal. Don&#8217;t look
so plumb sober. I lived for a month on roots
once....&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come back!&#8221; she cried imperiously. &#8220;Why
didn&#8217;t you tell me? I had a right to know!&#8221;</p>
<p>He said nothing. There was nothing to be
said. She didn&#8217;t know what starvation was
really like, and he did. She led him back to the
camp, her face flushed and her eyes moist.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now sit down. I&#8217;m going to cook you a good
meal, and you are going to eat it. Where&#8217;s your
grub sack?&#8221;</p>
<p>His mouth closed down with a snap. If she
saw the grub sack the whole truth must come out,
and he didn&#8217;t want that.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve had my meal,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263' name='page_263'></a>263</span>
trouble now. I ain&#8217;t a bit hungry. Them roots
is sure wonderful when you git used&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>She shrugged her shoulders impatiently, and
looked round for his kit. Seeing it a few yards
away she rose from her knees and made for it,
but his hand came out and stopped her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Angela,&#8221; he said hoarsely. &#8220;We got days
to go yet....&#8221;</p>
<p>She put his arm aside and reached the pile of
kit. The sack in which his food was carried was
a white canvas one, easily distinguished from the
rest. She turned over one or two things and
found it&mdash;flat and empty.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gone&mdash;all gone!&#8221;</p>
<p>She stood with it hanging from her fingers as
a suspicion entered her mind. Slowly she came
to him, her bosom throbbing madly.</p>
<p>&#8220;What have you done with it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess I&#8217;ve bin a bit too free with it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What have you done with it?&#8221; she reiterated.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wal, it&#8217;s gone, and squealing won&#8217;t help
matters.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where has it gone?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where does food usually go? See here,
Angela&mdash;I&#8217;m right sorry about it all. Maybe
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264' name='page_264'></a>264</span>
I&#8217;ll shoot a bird to-morrow, and then I&#8217;ll have a
gormandizing jag.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the stratagem failed to have effect. She
was thinking of the apparent inexhaustibility of
her own supply. Two nights before she had
heard him go from the tent, and the next morning
the ring which he usually wore on his finger
was found in her sack. Moreover, the contents
had seemed strangely increased. She saw it all
now. The bag slipped from her fingers and she
covered her face with her hands.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know!... I know now!&#8221; she burst out.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve been eating your food as well as my own.
You have been replenishing my supply from
your own sack. All this time you&#8217;ve been famished
with hunger, and you&#8217;ve let me go on eating&mdash;living
on your hunger. Oh, God! don&#8217;t
you see how mean I feel?&#8221; Then her eyes flashed
and her tone changed. &#8220;But you had no right
to do it. How dare you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess I&#8217;d dare a lot of things for certain
reasons. See here, you&#8217;ve bin through a hell of
a lot up here, but you&#8217;ve never suffered hunger,
and it wouldn&#8217;t be good for you, I&#8217;m thinking.
Cold and frostbite is one thing, and hunger&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265' name='page_265'></a>265</span>
another. There&#8217;s nothin&#8217; like starvation to freeze
up your heart. It&#8217;s like a red-hot iron inside,
gittin&#8217; redder and redder.... Shootin&#8217; a
starvin&#8217; dog&#8217;s a mercy, I reckon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it any worse for me than you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yep.&#8221;</p>
<p>With that dogmatic assertion he relapsed into
silence. Angela flew to her own small supply of
food and produced the requisities for a good
meal. The mixture was soon spluttering over
the fire, emitting odors almost unendurable to
the hungry, watching Jim. Angela turned it out
on to a plate.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come along,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I told you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>She went to him and put her arm round him.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;ve any regard for me&mdash;if you want to
make me happy, eat that.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was the first time she had ever displayed any
real depth of feeling, and it was like balm to
him. But his obstinacy prevailed, for in the dish
was a normal day&#8217;s ration for the two of them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe you think we&#8217;ll drop across food on
trail, but we won&#8217;t. There&#8217;s nothin&#8217; to be got
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266' name='page_266'></a>266</span>
until the first freighter comes up the river.
Better put it back.&#8221;</p>
<p>She took her arm away and went to the dish.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you won&#8217;t eat, I&#8217;ll throw it away&mdash;I swear
I will!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Angela!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s your own maxim, your own teaching&mdash;share
and share alike. I won&#8217;t recognize any
other doctrine. It shall go to the birds unless....&#8221;</p>
<p>She meant what she said, and he knew it.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right&mdash;I&#8217;ll eat,&#8221; he mumbled.</p>
<p>Half an hour later, feeling a hundred per cent.
better, he rose to his feet and entered the tent,
where Angela was busily engaged putting down
the blankets on improvised mattresses of
gathered moss and young bracken.</p>
<p>&#8220;See,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I&#8217;ve split up the food again.
How long will it last if eked out?&#8221;</p>
<p>He turned out one of the sacks and ran his
eye over the contents.</p>
<p>&#8220;Two days, at a pinch.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And how soon can we make Dawson?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A week, hard plugging.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267' name='page_267'></a>267</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Then it looks as though the &#8217;pinch&#8217; will have
to be resorted to&mdash;and expanded.&#8221;</p>
<p>He saw she was smiling as she tucked his
bottom blanket carefully under the moss.</p>
<p>&#8220;When you put it that way we can make anything,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;If I had a canoe we could
push up the river a good deal faster than overland,
but I ain&#8217;t got one&mdash;and that&#8217;s the rub.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then we&#8217;ll have to depend on luck.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No friend o&#8217; mine. Luck don&#8217;t cut much ice
up here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Angela shook her head. She had a slight
suspicion that luck had not entirely deserted
them. Though the future seemed black and
threatening, were there not compensating
elements? There were worse things than dying
in the wilderness with a &#8220;wild man.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>
<h3>COMPLICATIONS</h3>
</div>

<p>Devinne&#8217;s trading-post was not the
sort of place one expected to find in
Alaska. Devinne himself was a queer
customer, a man of good education and birth.
That he chose to establish a trading-post on the
upper reaches of the Yukon was a mystery to all
who knew him. The real reason was a secret in
the heart of Devinne, and had reference to a
quarrel in a Parisian club in which a blow had
been struck in a moment of pardonable fury, resulting
in the death of a revered citizen of Paris.</p>
<p>Devinne found the Yukon district a comparatively
&#8220;healthy&#8221; spot. He had started the trading-post
four years back, and had prospered very
considerably. He had started in a small way,
taking trips into Indian villages and bargaining
for furs. A man of quick intelligence, he soon
acquired a substantial knowledge of most of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269' name='page_269'></a>269</span>
queer Indian dialects, which proved a tremendous
asset from a business point of view.</p>
<p>After one year&#8217;s profitable trading he had
built the &#8220;post.&#8221; It was a fairly commodious
affair, boasting three rooms upstairs and three below,
plus a long shed attached to the rear of the
main building where he carried on his business,
with two half-breed assistants, who slept in the
shed itself.</p>
<p>A year after the post was completed Natalie,
Devinne&#8217;s only daughter, a woman of uncertain
age, came out to keep house for him. Natalie
had all the quick passions of her Southern
mother, which doubtlessly accounted for the sudden
rupture between herself and her husband
after but a brief span of married life.</p>
<p>Two years in Alaska had not changed her
nature. Unlike Devinne, she was quick to anger.
She ruled her father as completely as she had
ruled her husband, until that worthy sought
refuge under the wing of another, less tyrannous,
woman.</p>
<p>On this night, in late May, Natalie and her
father sat in the big front room which afforded
them an uninterrupted view of the river. Natalie
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270' name='page_270'></a>270</span>
was busy at crochet-work, and Devinne was going
over some accounts with a view to finding
what profit the year had yielded. Judging by his
frequent purrs and sighs, the result was not
displeasing. Natalie looked up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; she queried, in French.</p>
<p>&#8220;Another good season and we&#8217;ll be able to get
away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where to?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Los Angeles would not be so bad. A good,
equable climate, a little society, and a club or
two&mdash;ah!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But is it safe?&#8221;</p>
<p>He furrowed his brows.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll risk it. Four years is a long time, and
I think I am changed somewhat. You won&#8217;t be
sorry to leave this country&mdash;ma cherie?&#8221;</p>
<p>Natalie put down her crochet.</p>
<p>&#8220;No. It seems a waste of one&#8217;s life. Mon
Dieu, I am tired of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Devinne cocked up his ears as two shrill hoots
came from the river. He sprang to the window
and saw the dim light of a ship going up the
river.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the old <i>Topeka</i> back again. She&#8217;s early
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_271' name='page_271'></a>271</span>
this season, which is fortunate, for we&#8217;re badly
in need of that consignment. &#8217;Chips&#8217; will have
to get up to Dawson to-morrow and bring the
stuff back. Maybe the piano is aboard.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Was it wise to get the piano, when we are
leaving next fall?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We can sell it&mdash;at a profit, too.... What&#8217;s
that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8221; was a sharp rap on the outer door. It
was repeated again in a few seconds. Callers
were unusual at that time of the day, but all
callers were welcome enough in Alaska. Natalie
ran out and unbarred the door. In the dim light
she saw the figure of a big man supporting a
woman, who was obviously on the verge of utter
collapse.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, vat is it?&#8221; she ejaculated in her broken
English.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all that&#8217;s left of us,&#8221; growled a voice.
&#8220;I guess we&#8217;re nearly beat.&#8221;</p>
<p>He staggered, and Natalie ran to the mute
figure of Angela. &#8220;Father, father!&#8221; she cried.</p>
<p>Devinne appeared in a second, and took in the
situation at a glance. While Jim relinquished
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272' name='page_272'></a>272</span>
Angela to the excited Natalie, Devinne took him
by the arm and led him into the sitting-room.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s good fortune that led you here. How
long have you been without food?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Two days.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll soon put that right. Don&#8217;t talk till
you&#8217;ve eaten. I&#8217;ll get you something to take the
edge off while Natalie cooks a sound meal.&#8221;</p>
<p>He left Jim reclining on the couch, and came
back with a loaf of bread and some canned beef.
Jim eyed the food with ravenous eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s Angela?&#8221; he queried.</p>
<p>&#8220;Angela?&mdash;who is&mdash;ah yes, your companion.
You haven&#8217;t told me your name.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Conlan&mdash;Jim Conlan.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And the lady?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My&mdash;my sister.&#8221;</p>
<p>He started to see Angela standing in the doorway,
her arm linked in that of Natalie. She
regarded him in amazement as the untruth left
his lips, and then came and sat down at the table.</p>
<p>&#8220;You vill excuse me. I go make something
verra nice,&#8221; said Natalie, and vanished into the
kitchen.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273' name='page_273'></a>273</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Now go ahead,&#8221; said Devinne. &#8220;Regard that
as <i>hors-d&#8217;&oelig;uvre</i> till the supper is ready.&#8221;</p>
<p>They partook of the good home-made bread,
and of the meat, Devinne regarding them with
kindly eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a good thing the steamer is early, or we
might have been as badly off as you. We have
but a week&#8217;s supply, but the new lot will be down
in a day or two.... Where have you come
from?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Endicott,&#8221; said Jim. &#8220;We lost our dogs and
got delayed some. Gee, but food is a wonderful
thing!&#8221;</p>
<p>Natalie came in and discreetly removed the
remainder of the loaf and the meat.</p>
<p>&#8220;No more, pleece,&#8221; she said. &#8220;You vill haf no
room for zat supper. I haf him on the stove
now.&#8221;</p>
<p>She laughed merrily, not a little pleased at this
unexpected invasion. For months she had seen
no one but wandering Indians and grizzled
miners. It was a delight to hold conversation
with a pretty woman&mdash;not to mention a strapping
son of Hercules, like unto nothing she had
ever seen before.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274' name='page_274'></a>274</span></p>
<p>Jim found Devinne a charming and interesting
host. Over a pipe they discussed New York
and London, these being Devinne&#8217;s idea of paradise,
a point of view which Jim scarcely shared.
By the time supper was ready they all felt like
old friends. Natalie, much to Angela&#8217;s embarrassment,
displayed particular interest in Jim.</p>
<p>&#8220;But your brother&mdash;he ees magnifique! Such
eyes&mdash;such limbs! Mon Dieu, but I haf nevaire
seen one lak him. And you go all zat way wit&#8217;
him?&mdash;you are verra brave&mdash;and so beautiful.&#8221;</p>
<p>Angela would have liked to return the compliment&mdash;for
the French woman was beautiful
enough, and fascinating to her finger-tips&mdash;but
she felt annoyed that Jim should have placed her
in this position. Why should he attempt to pass
her off as his sister? It was unpardonable! And
here was this French woman regarding him with
eyes of obvious admiration. Angela felt a queer
little stab in the region of her heart.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can trade you some food the day after to-morrow,
Conlan,&#8221; said Devinne.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess I&#8217;ll be making Dawson to-morrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nonsense! If you succeed in getting food
there, it will be at famine price. Better stay.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275' name='page_275'></a>275</span>
Nay, I insist. It isn&#8217;t often we have the pleasure
of meeting good company, and we claim you as
guests for at least two days.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim glanced at Angela and saw her mouth
twitch. For some reason Angela was keen to get
away, but nevertheless there was sound reasoning
in Devinne&#8217;s argument. At Dawson food would
fetch a fabulous price, until the freights could
bring in bigger supplies. Devinne, with his acute
business acumen, had insured a certain supply by
ordering the stuff at the close of the last season
and paying freightage in advance.</p>
<p>Jim intimated that he would wait for the
arrival of the food, much to Angela&#8217;s chagrin
and to Natalie&#8217;s unconcealed joy.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll have to rig you up a bed in the next
room, Conlan,&#8221; said Devinne. &#8220;We only boast
one spare room upstairs, and ladies come first&mdash;even
in Alaska.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So you&#8217;ve no luck at prospecting?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nope. I guess we came too late.&#8221;</p>
<p>Devinne shook his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;This country is full of gold, but it&#8217;s just luck
in finding it. I know old-timers who have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276' name='page_276'></a>276</span>
mushed their legs off without striking a cent.
On the other hand young Cheechakos, without a
grain of experience, have gone straight to the
gold and made millions. You aren&#8217;t giving
up?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I never give up,&#8221; growled Jim. &#8220;But there&#8217;s
my&mdash;my sister to be considered. &#8217;Tain&#8217;t a kind
thing to yank a woman over the trail in winter.&#8221;</p>
<p>Devinne agreed with a nod of his head. Conlan
puzzled him a good deal. It was amazing
that he should be the brother of that beautiful
blonde girl, who spoke in cultured tones and was
as different from him as chalk is from cheese.
There lurked the suspicions that their relationship
was other than brother and sister, but being
a cleanminded man he strove to banish the
thought.</p>
<p>In the meantime Natalie was showing Angela
the sleeping-room reserved for her, and talking
at a tremendous rate about &#8220;La Belle France&#8221;
and all the things she had sacrificed&mdash;among these
latter she omitted to include her late husband.
Doubtless she no longer regarded him as a
sacrifice!</p>
<hr class='minor' />

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277' name='page_277'></a>277</span></div>
<p>It was later in the evening that Jim faced the
music. He carried Angela&#8217;s few belongings up
to her room, and was bidding her &#8220;good-night&#8221;
when she turned on him with flashing eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;How dare you tell lies?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How dare you tell that woman I was your
sister?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t. I told Devinne.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t quibble. I&mdash;I thought you were above
mean falsehood.&#8221;</p>
<p>He shrugged his shoulders, surprised that she
did not see his object.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I had told her the truth it would have been
embarrassing for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For me!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yep. Angela, don&#8217;t you see it would
mean&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It would mean that we should have to act as
man and wife.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, haven&#8217;t you always tried to act as&mdash;husband?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have I?&mdash;I guess not. And I&#8217;m not wanting
to take advantage of a situation. If you&#8217;ll look
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_278' name='page_278'></a>278</span>
clearly you&#8217;ll see this thing square. I guess it
would have bin awkward if they had yanked us
into this room&mdash;together.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said &#8220;good-night&#8221; softly and shut the door.
Angela sat down on the bed and stared at the
wall. So he had thought of that! It was amazing
the things he could think of when he tried
hard!</p>
<p>She tore off her clothes and flung herself on to
the pillow, annoyed, exasperated, and generally
bewildered. Then she got up, lighted the candle
again, and surveyed her fresh, incomparable
beauty in the mirror.</p>
<p>&#8220;Am I getting old&mdash;ugly?&#8221; she murmured.
&#8220;Ah yes&mdash;Natalie is pretty enough to get things
if she tries!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>
<h3>NATALIE TRIES HER LUCK</h3>
</div>

<p>Life at the trading-post might have been a
pleasant thing to Angela but for one
patent fact, and this fact was rendered
more palpable every hour. It requires a woman
to thoroughly analyze another woman&#8217;s feelings,
and Angela experienced little difficulty in probing
the heart of Natalie. From the moment
when Jim had first stepped through the doorway
Angela had been aware of the fact that all
Natalie&#8217;s interest was centered on him.</p>
<p>She had seen the look of suspense in Natalie&#8217;s
face when Devinne had inquired of Jim their
relationship, and had heard the soft sigh when
the untruthful answer was returned. Hitherto
she had imagined love at first sight to be a mere
figure of speech, but not now. It was chiefly that
fact which aroused her anger against Jim. It
looked as if he deliberately gave the lie to encourage
these passionate advances of Natalie.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_280' name='page_280'></a>280</span></p>
<p>Jim himself was the flower of innocence.
Natalie was certainly an attractive woman, and
she had the knack of enhancing her attractiveness
by subtle, and not ungraceful, movement of her
body and limbs. But all her charms were
eclipsed by the mystical beauty of Angela. But
for her constant obtrusiveness, it is doubtful
whether Jim would have noticed her prettiness at
all. He found the post a pleasant enough place
after the eternal discomforts of the trail, and
Devinne a thoroughly good fellow.</p>
<p>He did not fail to notice a queer change in
Angela&mdash;a relapse into moody silence, so different
from the cheerfulness which she had exhibited
in the immediate past&mdash;but ascribed it to the fact
that she was still pining for civilization and the
old life. And he meant that she should have this,
despite her resolution to accept nothing from
him. Once they touched Dawson, he meant to
get her aboard a boat&mdash;by physical force if
necessary&mdash;and face the miseries of life without
her.</p>
<p>For this purpose he kept intact the wad of
notes necessary for her passage, and sought
Devinne with a view to raising money on an
article of great sentimental, and moderate intrinsic,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_281' name='page_281'></a>281</span>
value&mdash;the cigarette-case given him by his
old chums at Medicine Bow.</p>
<p>Devinne was amazed when the proposition was
put to him. He had no idea that his guest was
reduced to such plights.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll loan you the food with pleasure,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;There&#8217;s no need to part with something you
evidently love.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim shook his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s it worth?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Difficult to say&mdash;at least a thousand dollars.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wal, see here, you loan me five hundred on
it with the option of redeeming it within a year.
I&#8217;ll sure strike gold by then.&#8221;</p>
<p>Devinne nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well, if you insist. I&#8217;ll be here until
next spring. It&#8217;ll be waiting for you any time
you drop in.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim pocketed the notes and commenced to bargain
for several necessaries apart from the
anxiously awaited food.</p>
<p>In the meantime Natalie was preparing for
attack. She garbed herself in her most seductive
dress, and assailed Jim as he was leaving
Devinne, and commenced to inveigle him into
accompanying her on a walk.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282' name='page_282'></a>282</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I was just going to look over some gear in
the stores,&#8221; he explained.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, but zat can vait. Zee day is so magnifique.
Mees Angela, you say to him hee es to
come.&#8221;</p>
<p>Angela, who had just entered the passage,
turned crimson.</p>
<p>&#8220;My brother usually pleases himself,&#8221; she
said, and walked away.</p>
<p>A few minutes&#8217; artful pleading, and Jim was
beaten. It seemed outrageous to refuse her so
small a&mdash;pleasure. He got his hat and stalked
along beside her. Angela watched them disappear
towards the river.</p>
<p>She felt furious with Jim&mdash;furious because he
could not see that this brazen-faced woman was
making love to him all the time. The studied
voluptuous movements, the bright lift of the eyes,
the mad rush to secure for him anything she
thought he might need&mdash;how could any man but
a fool misinterpret these actions? And Jim
looked so innocent&mdash;too innocent, she thought.
At any rate, he had gone with her on that walk,
and anything might happen&mdash;Natalie wouldn&#8217;t
care.</p>
<p>She went out of the house, feeling very wroth
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283' name='page_283'></a>283</span>
and very dejected. Devinne met her outside the
store and smiled in his quiet, pleasant fashion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s Jim?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I think he has gone for a walk with
Natalie.&#8221;</p>
<p>He raised his eyebrows and then laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Take care of your brother, Miss Conlan.
Natalie is a holy terror when she sets her cap at
something. I must confess he&#8217;s enough to turn
any normal woman&#8217;s head. Natalie has a weakness
for big men. It&#8217;ll certainly take a big one
to keep her in order.&#8221;</p>
<p>Angela forced a smile into her features, and
went away feeling more miserable than ever.
What might not a woman, well versed in love-making,
succeed in achieving with an ingenuous
fellow like Jim! And she was pretty too...!</p>
<p>It was three hours later when Jim and Natalie
returned. Angela saw them coming up through
the woods, Natalie chattering away in her broken
English and Jim laughing amusedly. She wondered
what had been the outcome of that journey.
Had Jim proved an easy victim to
Natalie&#8217;s attractions? Judging by the latter&#8217;s
behavior it looked like it. Natalie seemed very
happy and very sure of herself.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284' name='page_284'></a>284</span></p>
<p>It gave Angela food for considerable reflection.
If Jim chose to fall in love with the
woman, could she&mdash;Angela&mdash;have any objection?
Their relationship all through had been
that of master and chattel, and must remain so in
the circumstances. She had let him see that she
regarded herself merely as his purchased possession,
by a contract wherein love had not entered&mdash;on
her part. Why should he not make love to
another woman if he chose? Why not, indeed?
But it hurt nevertheless.</p>
<p>In the evening, returning from a walk along
the river, she met Natalie gathering spring
flowers in the woods beyond the house. The
latter welcomed her excitedly and took her arm
familiarly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it that you go to-morrow?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;If the food comes Jim is anxious to get to
Dawson.&#8221;</p>
<p>Natalie shot her a swift glance.</p>
<p>&#8220;To see you on zee boat?&#8221;</p>
<p>Angela gasped and stood still.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t understand you. What boat?&#8221;</p>
<p>Natalie raised her eyebrows.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ees eet not so?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285' name='page_285'></a>285</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But he tell papa&mdash;yes. He say eet ees no
place for you&mdash;ziss terr-ble climate. And you are
so beautiful.&#8221;</p>
<p>Angela felt as though a cold hand had suddenly
gripped her heart. So it had come to that
in less than two days!</p>
<p>&#8220;You are mistaken,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;But zat is strange. But, ma cherie, would
not you be glad to get away?&#8221;</p>
<p>Angela made no reply. She felt as though she
was choking. They entered the house and found
Jim talking with Devinne.</p>
<p>Later she had an opportunity of speaking to
him in private.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are we leaving to-morrow?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For Dawson?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And what then?&#8221;</p>
<p>She saw his lips tighten, and the delay in
replying told her that Natalie was right.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to send you back to England,&#8221; he
said slowly.</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t go.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_286' name='page_286'></a>286</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You must. Angela, be reasonable. I&#8217;m
broke, dead broke. I ought never to have
brought you here, but I expected to be successful&mdash;and
I ain&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that why you want me to go back?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course. You&mdash;you wanted your freedom,
and I&#8217;m giving it to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I told you I could take nothing from you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got to take this. Angela, you must
forget all about that&mdash;other matter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How can I forget, when for a year you have
constantly reminded me of it? If you put me on
that steamer I&#8217;ll get off at the first stopping-place
and come back to you. You bought me
and you&#8217;ve got to keep me until the debt is paid,
no matter how&mdash;unhappy it may make you.&#8221;</p>
<p>He smiled as he reflected that she thought her
presence could make him unhappy, when his
whole soul craved for her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe it is someone else&#8217;s happiness I am
thinking of,&#8221; he said quietly.</p>
<p>Someone else! The little green god within her
seized on the remark. She confronted him with
blazing eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;I knew it!&#8221; she said. &#8220;But you might have
been honest&mdash;you might have told me the truth.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_287' name='page_287'></a>287</span>
Oh God! and I&#8217;ve suffered all that&mdash;all that&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>The voice of Natalie came, singing, up the
passage. Without another word Angela went to
her room, leaving Jim bewildered by this strange
outburst.</p>
<hr class='minor' />

<p>It was late in the evening, and a full moon
sailed in the clear sky. The night was remarkably
warm, and Devinne and Natalie and Jim
were sitting on the veranda which skirted the
south side of the house. Jim sat in a brown
study, pondering over Angela&#8217;s changed attitude.
Devinne, as if by some pre-arranged plan,
silently vanished into the house. Jim was suddenly
brought to his senses by feeling Natalie&#8217;s
soft hand on his.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are verra&mdash;vat you call him&mdash;preoccupied,
eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was thinking.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of what?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, of many things.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The future?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure! It&#8217;s that that&#8217;s got me beat.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her hand tightened on his.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why should you care for the future? Ees
not zee present&mdash;beautiful?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288' name='page_288'></a>288</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Aye&mdash;if it could be always the present,&#8221; he
muttered.</p>
<p>&#8220;But zee future can be verra beautiful if one
wishes so. Eet ees for you and for me to make
zat future jus lak heaven!&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim pulled himself up with a jerk. It was not
the words that affected him so much as the blaze
of quick passion in her eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s only one heaven for me, and I
guess I&#8217;ve fallen out of it,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Let us go
in.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no! The night is so wonderful&mdash;all, all
is wonderful. Everywhere zere ees love&mdash;in zee
trees, in zee wind. Do you not feel him?&#8221;</p>
<p>If Jim felt anything at all it was blue fear. He
came to see the position as it was. She believed
him a free man&mdash;even believed he might love her.
The seemingly trivial actions of the afternoon
became newly interpreted. Before he could get
his breath Natalie rose to the occasion.</p>
<p>&#8220;You vill come back to-morrow after zee boat
has gone? It has been so beautiful, zese two days.
Say you vill come back!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Natalie!&#8221; he gasped.</p>
<p>She flung her arms round his neck and pressed
her face to his.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_289' name='page_289'></a>289</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Ees eet zat I am too bold for your Eenglish
ways? But I am not ashamed&mdash;no. I love you&mdash;oh,
so much!&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>With a gasp he unlinked her arms and stood
up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Natalie, what are you saying?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why should I not say zat I love you?&#8221; she
retorted hotly.</p>
<p>&#8220;You love me!&#8221; he muttered. &#8220;By God&mdash;I
never dreamed&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Jeem!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop!&#8221; he roared. &#8220;Listen here, you&#8217;d
better know the truth. I&#8217;m married!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Married?&#8221; she almost screamed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jest that.&#8221;</p>
<p>She stood up, all her wonderful castles strewn
before her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mon Dieu!&#8221; she groaned. &#8220;Mon Dieu!&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a sound from behind, and a figure
slipped from out of the gloom&mdash;Angela. She
stood facing them, her breast heaving under her
emotions. Jim, seizing the opportunity, vanished
into the house sick at the thought that
Angela should have heard.</p>
<p>Angela approached Natalie and placed her
arm round the latter&#8217;s waist.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_290' name='page_290'></a>290</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Natalie,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I couldn&#8217;t help hearing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&mdash;you heard?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. And I had a right to hear.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No one had a right&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, someone had&mdash;his wife.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&mdash;his wife?&#8221;</p>
<p>Angela inclined her head.</p>
<p>&#8220;But he say you are his sister&mdash;and you act
like that.&#8221;</p>
<p>The problem became clearer to her. &#8220;Ah, I
see&mdash;he say that because he do not want to cause
you embarrassment&mdash;because you do not love
him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Angela turned to her in righteous indignation.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t understand&mdash;he bought me, with
money. I&mdash;I can&#8217;t explain.... But I am sorry
this has happened.&#8221;</p>
<p>Natalie wiped away a tear, sniffed, and then
composed herself.</p>
<p>&#8220;I vill try to forget,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I am verra
glad eet ees you&mdash;for you are so beautiful....
But I vish it was me he bought,&#8221; she added
wistfully.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>
<h3>GOLD</h3>
</div>

<p>The one desire, obsessing Jim&#8217;s mind, was
to get away from Devinne&#8217;s place.
Natalie&#8217;s unblushing overtures had
scared him very considerably. Women had always
puzzled him&mdash;they puzzled him even more
now. He certainly had no use for women who
ran at one in that way. Far better for them to be
like Angela, cold and unapproachable, alluring
yet repellent. One knew where one was with
Angela, but never with Natalie.</p>
<p>And Angela had heard, and perhaps seen, all
that had taken place! He mopped his brow as he
reflected upon her feelings in the matter. He
was modest and foolish enough to think that
jealousy was out of the question, but she would
undoubtedly object to playing second fiddle to
Natalie. So much he knew of her.</p>
<p>Fearful of meeting Natalie at breakfast, he
rose early and made his way out, determined not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_292' name='page_292'></a>292</span>
to return until Chips the half-breed arrived with
his cargo. A little distance from the house he
stopped, and returned for the shovel and pick
and washing-pan, with a view to filling in his
spare time and banishing from his mind the painful
scene of last night.</p>
<p>The red sun was just mounting the horizon as
he strode off, and birds were singing gayly in the
woods. Half an hour&#8217;s walk brought him out of
the timber into comparatively bare country.
Aimlessly he wandered on, drinking in the fresh
morning air and stopping to gaze at the brilliant
landscape from time to time. Below him, to the
west, a small creek made a junction with the
Yukon, its red water foaming over broken
boulders, and leaping ten perpendicular feet to
join the parent stream. He sauntered down
towards it, the washing-pan clanking against the
shovel as he walked.</p>
<p>Few men would have dug for gold along that
creek; the surface had all the characteristics of
unadulterated muck. He stuck the pick into it
for the mere fun of hitting something. Though
the sun shone warmly and rich the grass grew on
either bank, the eternal ice was down under the
surface.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_293' name='page_293'></a>293</span></p>
<p>In one hour he managed to dig out a cubic
yard of earth. Having satisfied his hunger for
exercise, he flung the shovel down and began to
smoke.</p>
<p>Looking down the creek, he saw a clumsy flat-bottomed
boat, piled high with cargo, swirling
down the river, with a tousled-haired man in
the stern keeping her from the bank by means
of a pole.</p>
<p>&#8220;Chips,&#8221; he murmured. &#8220;He must have
started last night. So the food is here, and we
can hike out to-day, thank God!&#8221;</p>
<p>As he looked, the punt struck a submerged
sandbank and beached on it. Chips&#8217; little body
bent on the pole, but except to swivel the punt on
its axis it had no other result.</p>
<p>Jim stood up, and seizing his tools, made
down the creek. He shouted to Chips, and the
latter looked at him imploringly. Jim waded
through the water and reached the craft.</p>
<p>&#8220;You should have kept her out more in the
center, my friend,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Current go swift there&mdash;no make the landing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hm! perhaps you&#8217;re right. Here, take these
aboard&mdash;I&#8217;ll come back with you.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_294' name='page_294'></a>294</span></p>
<p>He put the shovel and pick over the side of the
boat and catching hold of the stern, pushed hard.
Chips gave a yell of joy as the punt slithered and
then jolted into deep water. Jim clambered
aboard and took the pole. Half an hour later
they beached her at the landing-place.</p>
<p>Devinne and the other half-breed came running
down the slope. The former looked at Jim
in surprise.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where did you go to? We waited breakfast
for twenty minutes, and then discovered you
were not in.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sorry,&#8221; mumbled Jim. &#8220;I was mad for a
walk. I met Chips up the river, stuck on a sandbank,
so I came along. He ain&#8217;t a good sailor.&#8221;
Chips grinned, and he and his comrade commenced
to pack the cargo up the hill. Jim
walked back with Devinne; the latter regarded
him in curious fashion. Entering the house, he
met Angela, but Natalie was pleasantly absent.
Angela surveyed his wet figure with a smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;Been swimming?&#8221; she queried.</p>
<p>&#8220;No. I&#8217;ve bin hurrying along the stores. I
met Chips.&#8221;</p>
<p>She was obviously pleased with the news.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then we can leave to-day?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_295' name='page_295'></a>295</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Sure&mdash;and the sooner the better,&#8221; he responded
emphatically.</p>
<p>She was silent for a moment, then she said
softly:</p>
<p>&#8220;Why weren&#8217;t you in for breakfast?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t feel like it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Was it because of last night?&#8221;</p>
<p>He nodded gloomily.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m real scared of that woman,&#8221; he murmured.
&#8220;Gee! I shan&#8217;t be happy till we clear
away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you didn&#8217;t know&mdash;know she&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Know!&#8221; he ejaculated. &#8220;Jumping rattlesnakes!
It knocked me silly. Angela, you don&#8217;t
think I&mdash;gave her reason to believe&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think you did. But, Jim, you are an
extraordinary man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t get you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not to know when a woman loves you.&#8221;</p>
<p>He puckered his lips and shook his head in
perplexity.</p>
<p>&#8220;How&#8217;s a chap goin&#8217; to tell? It&#8217;s a kind of
disease that takes folks different ways. Can&#8217;t
rely on the symptoms. I once thought&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>She sunk her head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t talk of that&mdash;now. Here comes
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_296' name='page_296'></a>296</span>
Devinne. Let us get the packs ready and go,
while the day is yet young.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='minor' />

<p>Half an hour later they were ready for the
thirty-mile journey to Dawson. They said good-bye
to Devinne, and to Natalie, who appeared at
the last moment, exhibiting a gayety which was
obviously superficial. She kissed Angela, and
clung for a moment to Jim&#8217;s hand to whisper:</p>
<p>&#8220;I vish you every happiness. <i>Bon voyage!</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>They saw her waving her handkerchief as they
entered the woods and headed for their destination.</p>
<p>Traveling was pleasant enough, though the
packs were heavy. Now that the following day
would see them at Dawson, the question of the
future loomed larger than ever. Broke, travel-stained,
and tormented by the thought of parting,
Jim could find little conversation, though
Angela seemed cheerful enough. They came to
the creek where Jim had rested but an hour or
two before, and waded across it at the shallowest
part. Traversing the opposite bank, Angela
stopped and stared at the newly excavated hole.</p>
<p>&#8220;Someone has been digging here!&#8221; she exclaimed.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_297' name='page_297'></a>297</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Me,&#8221; said Jim. &#8220;This morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To find what we always find&mdash;muck?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t wash it. Chips turned up and was
in trouble&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>She stared at him in amazement.</p>
<p>&#8220;You dug all that and didn&#8217;t wash it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the use? It didn&#8217;t look good to
me.&#8221;</p>
<p>She shrugged her shoulders and slipped her
pack down.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong?&#8221; he queried.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing. I&#8217;m going to wash it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Better not waste time&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Waste time! A few minutes won&#8217;t make
any difference, considering we&#8217;ve wasted a year
already.&#8221;</p>
<p>He turned from her with a sigh. She called it
wasted, but it hadn&#8217;t been wasted to him. Now
that the end of the journey was nigh, he found a
strange joy in looking back over the past. Every
little incident of their strange pilgrimage seemed
to have garnered gold about it. Compared to the
lonely, forbidding future, the past was like a
paradise, to live for ever in his heart and mind.
He had missed much, but he had gained something&mdash;passionate,
all-consuming love for a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_298' name='page_298'></a>298</span>
woman. Though she gave little in return, it
mattered not. The finest type of love does not
make demands upon that which it worships. He
could keep her still by the same means as he had
retained her all along, but his mode of thought
had changed somewhat. A deeper love had
grown out of the old tempestuous, tyrannous
thing. It were better to give than to receive.</p>
<p>He watched her shaking the washing-pan in
the water, her clear-cut face intent on the task
at hand, and her hair glinting in the sunshine.
She came splashing through the water with the
pan in her hands.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look&mdash;something glitters there!&#8221;</p>
<p>He took it from her and gave one glance at the
contents&mdash;a small heap of black and yellow.</p>
<p>Then he laughed loudly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then it isn&#8217;t&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; she commenced.</p>
<p>He ceased to laugh as he probed the dust in the
pan. The whole thing was so miraculous to him,
he could scarcely find expression.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve found it, Angela,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s
gold&mdash;real high-grade ore. You&#8217;ve dealt a
straight flush at the last hand.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But it doesn&#8217;t look like gold!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That black stuff ain&#8217;t gold, it&#8217;s magnetic ore.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_299' name='page_299'></a>299</span>
Gee, wash some more dirt. This looks like
Eldorado!&#8221;</p>
<p>He flung down his pack and started shoveling
out more gravel from the hole. In the meantime
Angela washed the pay-dirt and placed the residue
in a handkerchief. Excitement grew as the
work went forward. Lower down, the yield was
enormous. The pile in the handkerchief grew to
an enormous size. Taking no heed of time, the
work went on until the declining sun called them
from their labors.</p>
<p>Jim poured a pound or so of mercury into a
tub of water, and submerged the results of their
toil in it.</p>
<p>&#8220;You think it is gold?&#8221; she queried.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gold! Tons of it. I&#8217;ll show you later. Come
along and have some food.&#8221;</p>
<p>An hour or two later Jim brought from the
tub the amalgam formed by the combination of
the pan gold-dust with the mercury. This was
squeezed through a bearskin, the process segregating
the gold and depositing the mercury
back into the tub.</p>
<p>What little mercury remained in the glittering
mass was evaporated out in a shovel over the
camp-fire.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_300' name='page_300'></a>300</span></p>
<p>For the first time Angela realized why the
gold-miner, once successful, could never rid himself
of the fever. All the bitter disappointments,
pessimism, and misery vanished in the presence
of that sizzling mass in the shovel. It was
difficult to believe that here, dug from the frozen
earth, was the thing for which men suffered,
sinned, and died.</p>
<p>Jim seized the gold nugget with his leathern
hands and tossed it into the air, caught it again,
and dropped it into his hat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Angela, you&#8217;re right. We&#8217;re bursting with
wealth! There ain&#8217;t bin nothin&#8217; like this since
that guy found Bonanza Creek. And now I&#8217;ve
got to git to Dawson.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dawson!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yep. It ain&#8217;t ours yet. I&#8217;ve got to stake
claims&mdash;one for you and one for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll come too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nope. Any prowling broiler might bunch
in and take a fancy to this pitch. You jest sit
tight. I&#8217;ll be back to-morrow morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you can&#8217;t get to Dawson and back in one
night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t I? Jest watch my smoke. I&#8217;ll get the
claims registered and yank a man up here from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_301' name='page_301'></a>301</span>
the Syndicate. We&#8217;ll sure sell out and save
digging. We&#8217;ll come down the river. You ain&#8217;t
skeered of stoppin&#8217; alone?&#8221;</p>
<p>She laughed at his serious question, and
watched him making ready for the journey. In
a few minutes he had washed, shaved, and put on
a pair of walking boots. He turned and nodded
and went off with huge strides.</p>
<p>She continued to sit by the fire, no longer
wrestling with the future. In that unexpected
moment of wonderful luck, she had seen the
future clear-cut as it affected her. The pendulum
swung the other way now&mdash;she meant to
leave Alaska with the least possible delay.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>
<h3>DEPARTURE</h3>
</div>

<p>She arose in the morning from dreams that
were strangely mixed, to find that the good
fortune was no part of the dream, but a
reality. Singing she lighted a fire and prepared
a more than usually appetizing breakfast to celebrate
the occasion.</p>
<p>She estimated that if Jim found the Registrar
and the official of the Mining Syndicate early in
the morning, he would arrive there about midday.
She laughed amusedly as she thought of him and
his inflexible will. She imagined him in Dawson,
yanking the official out of his office and hustling
him down the river at enormous speed.</p>
<p>The morning passed on leaden wings and no
boat appeared on the river. Impatiently she
climbed the highest part of the bank and looked
towards Dawson, but only a couple of Indian
canoes came to view.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_303' name='page_303'></a>303</span></p>
<p>It was an hour later when two riders came
tearing down the hill. She recognized Jim as the
foremost of the two, and ran to meet him. He
came thundering down upon her, leaned over,
grasped her arms and hauled her up before him.
The mount turned, reared high on its hind-legs
until she shivered with fear, and then stood perfectly
still. Jim laughingly helped her down and
waited for the second man.</p>
<p>&#8220;Came on hosses,&#8221; he explained, &#8220;because I
calculated we&#8217;d git back easier that way. I&#8217;ve
got the mining man more&#8217;n interested, I guess.&#8221;</p>
<p>The latter arrived, perspiring freely. He
shook hands with Angela and sat down to get
cool.</p>
<p>&#8220;This husband, ma&#8217;am, of yours, beats the
railroad,&#8221; he ejaculated.</p>
<p>The horses were put on to some grazing
ground, and Stevens, the mining engineer, went
to examine the claims which Jim had meanwhile
staked.</p>
<p>The examination proved to be a brief affair.
Stevens, despite his professional calm, which was
a necessary asset to his business, was obviously
astonished at the richness of the claims.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_304' name='page_304'></a>304</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Wal, now to business. What do you want
for &#8217;em, Conlan?&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim nudged Angela.</p>
<p>&#8220;Call it a round million.&#8221;</p>
<p>Stevens put up his hands in horror.</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear sir!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wal, we&#8217;ll sell elsewhere.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;One moment. You must consider the fact
that up-river claims involve great expenditure in
working.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Cut all that,&#8221; retorted Jim. &#8220;What do you
offer?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I should recommend my company to buy at
half a million.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothin&#8217; doin&#8217;,&#8221; ejaculated Jim. &#8220;Sorry you
had the journey for nix. Anyway, we&#8217;re glad to
meet you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Stevens gulped. He began to realize he was
dealing with a &#8220;hard&#8221; man.</p>
<p>&#8220;See here,&#8221; said Jim, &#8220;we&#8217;re in a hurry, and
will sacrifice a pile to git this deal fixed. But
you gotta raise that offer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well, let us say $600,000.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the best I can do.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_305' name='page_305'></a>305</span></p>
<p>Angela was about to advise Jim to accept, but
he stopped her in time.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re going to pay $750,000, or negotiations
cease right now. And at that you&#8217;ll make a mint
of money. I ain&#8217;t breathed a word about this
yere creek yet. When I do you&#8217;ll see Dawson
City turning out good and strong to stake claims.
It&#8217;s up to your people to stake the rest of it, if
you pay up quick. Better say the word before
there&#8217;s a howling stampede down here.&#8221;</p>
<p>That argument settled Stevens. His own
quick mind had been turning on the same point.</p>
<p>&#8220;Call it a bargain,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Better come
right back now and get the transfer made.&#8221;</p>
<p>Two hours later the party set off, Angela
seated behind Jim on the big mare, and Stevens
riding ahead.</p>
<hr class='minor' />

<p>Jim was fortunate in getting two rooms at the
best hotel. Leaving Angela there, he went off
with Stevens to clinch the deal. He came back
later in the evening, looking a trifle downcast.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing wrong?&#8221; she queried.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nope. I got the money in American notes.&#8221;</p>
<p>He pulled a big pile of notes from his pocket
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_306' name='page_306'></a>306</span>
and placed them on the table, staring at them for
a few moments in silence. Then he began to
count them out.</p>
<p>&#8220;Better look after your own,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Guess
you&#8217;ll find that correct&mdash;375,000 dollars.&#8221;</p>
<p>Angela took them, then she leaned over the
table and looked at him queerly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some time ago and many times since you
made an offer?&#8221;</p>
<p>His hands gripped the table.</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You must remember&mdash;you&mdash;you said I was
for purchase to anyone who would pay the
price.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; he commenced brokenly.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are not going back on your word?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;O God! Angela, don&#8217;t force this on me!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean to&mdash;I have found a buyer.&#8221;</p>
<p>No sound escaped him for a few minutes, then
he gasped:</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is&mdash;he?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. I want my freedom&mdash;and all that
freedom means. Fifty thousand pounds you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_307' name='page_307'></a>307</span>
said&mdash;plus ten per cent. Here they are&mdash;275,000
dollars, with the exchange in your favor. Take
them!&#8221;</p>
<p>She put the notes in the center of the table, but
he made no attempt to touch them. They were
still there an hour later when she came from her
own room to fetch something she had left in his.
He was still sitting there, staring at them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jim, I&#8217;m going back to-morrow,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;The <i>Topeka</i> sails at eight o&#8217;clock. I shan&#8217;t stay
to breakfast. I thought I would let you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>He nodded, then as she was leaving:</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe you wouldn&#8217;t mind me seeing you
off?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I should be very glad,&#8221; she said indifferently.</p>
<p>When she had gone he put on his hat and went
into the streets. He had set his mind on a &#8220;jag&#8221;
of the worst description&mdash;to drink and forget.
He entered a saloon and mixed with the noisy
throng. He commenced to lavish drinks on all
and sundry, flinging notes around as though
they were dirt; but the drink tasted like poison.
The whole attempt ended in utter failure. Only
a beast could get drunk while the memory of such
a woman hung in his brain.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_308' name='page_308'></a>308</span></p>
<p>He wandered back to the hotel, sick at heart
and hating the fast-approaching morrow with its
heartache.... He had found gold, but he had
lost&mdash;lost completely in the larger battle. He
made no attempt to undress, but sat on his bed
and groaned.</p>
<p>When the dawn came he made himself presentable
and knocked at Angela&#8217;s door. He found
her clad for the journey, and several bags ready
for transit. He thought, too, she seemed delighted
at the prospects&mdash;delighted when his
heart was breaking!</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll take these things,&#8221; he said, and picked
up the bags.</p>
<p>They made their way to the jetty off which the
<i>Topeka</i> lay, with a gangway connecting. It was
near the time of departure, and nearly all the
passengers were aboard. A crowd of men stood
on the shore, passing remarks to those who were
leaving. Here and there a wet eye was in evidence,
as some unfortunate devil saw his wife and
child bound for the outer world&mdash;and himself left
to the tender mercies of the Klondyke.</p>
<p>Jim walked over the gangway and put down
the luggage. When he turned to Angela he saw
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_309' name='page_309'></a>309</span>
no sign of regret. She seemed as calm and collected
as she had been when first he met her.</p>
<p>&#8220;So this is the end of the great adventure,&#8221;
she said, smiling.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yep.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you&mdash;what do you intend doing?&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim gulped.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess the Klondyke is good enough for me.
See here, Angela, I bin pretty rough with you&mdash;but&mdash;it
wasn&#8217;t that I meant it that way. You
gotta make allowances for me. I lived among
animals for years. Maybe I kinder got like one,
without quite knowing it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps you may make allowances for me,
too. I was born in luxury, where hardship and
suffering never entered, where flattery and gifts
were the daily portion. I have never had a
chance&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Cut that,&#8221; he grunted. &#8220;You got grit and
pluck and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All aboard!&#8221; yelled a stentorian voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re off,&#8221; said Jim. &#8220;I&mdash;&mdash; Good-bye,
Angela. Maybe you&#8217;ll remember&mdash;sometimes.&#8221;</p>
<p>His eyes suddenly swam and he turned his
head away.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_310' name='page_310'></a>310</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Good-bye!&#8221; she murmured, and held his
hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;All aboard!&#8221; yelled the voice again.</p>
<p>A man began to move the gangway. The hand
in Jim&#8217;s suddenly clung on.</p>
<p>&#8220;I gotta go,&#8221; he moaned; &#8220;they&#8217;re pulling in
the plank.&#8221;</p>
<p>The steamer &#8220;honked&#8221; and began to move.
He looked at her appealingly and she placed
something into the palm of his hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s something I forgot to give you,&#8221; she said
softly.</p>
<p>He opened his hand and saw&mdash;a steamboat
ticket.</p>
<p>&#8220;But&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I bought two,&#8221; she said. &#8220;One for you and
one for me; and most of your clothes are in those
bags. Didn&#8217;t you miss them?&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>
<h3>CONCLUSION</h3>
</div>

<p>It was past midnight, and they were sitting in
the stern of the <i>Topeka</i> listening to the
chopchop of the water under her flat bottom.
Save for an occasional guffaw and curse, evidence
of some nocturnal card-party, silence
reigned aboard.</p>
<p>A full moon flooded the landscape, under
which the lofty banks, and the great mountains
beyond, shimmered in fantastic manner; wherein
the river, mighty as it was, seemed dwarfed like
unto a silver serpent, winding and turning down
to the sea.</p>
<p>Since morning Jim had lived in some wonderful
paradise, which even now seemed unstable,
fugitive, and dreamlike.</p>
<p>&#8220;Angela, tell me it isn&#8217;t a dream.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s no dream, dear.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_312' name='page_312'></a>312</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221;</p>
<p>He nestled closer to her and found the soft
small hand beneath the rug spread over their
knees. There was no attempt on her part to
withdraw it. Instead, she gripped the big
muscular fingers caressingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t get it straight yet,&#8221; he muttered. &#8220;It
was only this morning I was in hell. You&#8217;re sure
this ain&#8217;t some game that&#8217;ll land me back in the
mud?&#8221;</p>
<p>She laughed merrily and pulled his arm round
her waist.</p>
<p>&#8220;You dear, doubting man! If it&#8217;s me you
want I&#8217;m here with you. I&#8217;m substantial enough
to be felt, aren&#8217;t I?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But some things seem too good, and this is
one of them. I had a hunch I&#8217;d never quite reach
out over that pride of yours.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve no pride now, Jim, save pride of possession.&#8221;
Her eyes shone in the moonlight. &#8220;Back
there in the wilderness I dreamed of this day, but
it seemed so far away.&#8221;</p>
<p>He nodded his head slowly.</p>
<p>&#8220;And yet you ran away?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was on that last occasion that I found
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_313' name='page_313'></a>313</span>
myself. When I uttered that appalling, shameful
lie, I thought I hated you for your tyranny.
It was only when I had spent a night on the trail
alone that I saw how mean and low I had
fallen....&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. The tyranny was all imaginary&mdash;I saw
that. I could think of no act on your part that
wasn&#8217;t kind, or for my good. I came back to find
you ill, sick unto death. It seemed it was some
punishment on my head.... Oh, everything
changed in those few days. If you had died I
think I should have died too, though I didn&#8217;t love
you&mdash;then.&#8221;</p>
<p>He gave vent to a low hiss of incomparable
joy.</p>
<p>&#8220;And you do now?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>Her rapturous eyes were sufficient answer.</p>
<p>&#8220;It beats me,&#8221; he muttered. &#8220;It clean gets
me wondering that you can love a chap like me.
Once I thought you could, but then I didn&#8217;t
know you as you are&mdash;say, you&#8217;re sure about this,
ain&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>She gave him a hug.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_314' name='page_314'></a>314</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I agree with Natalie, no woman could help
loving you&mdash;eventually.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, she said that, did she?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wal, I guess love comes easy to a woman like
that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you don&#8217;t like the love that comes easy?&#8221;</p>
<p>He made a grimace.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothin&#8217; good ever comes easy. All the best
things have to be fought for, won by long suffering
and ordeal.&#8221;</p>
<p>They sat in silence for a time, the heart of each
overburdened with intense happiness. A light
breeze swept up the river, soughing through the
thick woods on the nearer bank.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was on such a night as this, back in England,
that I first told you I loved you,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can speak of that now without regret?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure. It was the finest thing I ever did. I
thought I was happy then, but now&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>The unfinished sentence conveyed all he meant
to convey. She turned her head until her full red
lips came near his.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_315' name='page_315'></a>315</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You kissed me then, Jim. Won&#8217;t you kiss
me now?&#8221;</p>
<p>She felt his great heart throbbing against her
bosom as he made haste to fulfill the invitation.
If he had dallied in his love-making he lingered
in his kissing. The whole world seemed to slide
into oblivion in that first passionate love-kiss.
She clung to him, wholly and eternally his, conscious
of nothing but the close presence of the
rough, strong man into whose adoring arms a
kindly providence had thrown her.</p>
<p>&#8220;By God, I&#8217;ll never let you go again!&#8221; he
hissed.</p>
<p>&#8220;By God, I don&#8217;t want to,&#8221; she retorted, with
a merry laugh.</p>
<p>&#8220;Over there&#8217;s England,&#8221; he cried, pointing
away to the east.</p>
<p>&#8220;And over here&#8217;s America&mdash;Colorado.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are we not to have a honeymoon&mdash;we who
were married but to-day?&#8221;</p>
<p>His eyes opened wide.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t mean&mdash;&mdash;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do. I want to spend it in your country,
among your people, in the places that you love
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_316' name='page_316'></a>316</span>
and will never forget. To me it is all the same,
wherever we go&mdash;Paradise.&#8221;</p>
<p>He took her head and pressed his cheek against
hers.</p>
<p>&#8220;You glorious woman!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You wonderful man!&#8221;</p>
